a ladies magazine: it is not good to be happy when others get into challenges.
it is written by Theopista Nsanzugwanko.
published: 25 September 2016.
challenges in the life of human beings is a normal thing may it be on our own causes or caused by another person especially in the pursuit of getting a life.
sometimes you can find yourself in the struggle of life and you get advisers which from one reason or the other you will find yourself in the hands of the law or struggling with huge debts which from one way or the other can make someone to lose hope.
but during the struggle of life for sure you are not supposed to lose lose, to get development and to grow personal economically, the family that surrounds you and also the whole economy.
even though, there is a character that causes men to be courageous and to say women do not love each other, mainly from their own actions.
for example, you find a particular women who has risen in development and even to own a company or a big business, now when she gets a challenge her fellow women will start to make fun and be happy.
truly, character like this is not good in the least, what is required is to look in which way a woman like that who is brave was able to lift up herself economically and when she gets a problem it is good to follow up and understand deeply what afflicted her, but not to be happy or to laugh at her because of the problem she is going through.
I am saying that because of the truth that there are reasons that can bring down a woman in her efforts because of getting bad counsel and with her assistants or any other thing therefore it is good women to cry with each other when a problem happens and to laugh with them when they succeed.
it reach a time when a women gets into problems you suffer together, sitting and discussing how to help each other so as prevent those problems and if you will not be successful and she will be taken to the courts therefore use her weaknesses to improve the services of others but not to change the discussion.
it is not pleasing at all the woman who was owning a big business, then got problems, then her fellow women are the ones on the front line to laugh.
even if she falls it is good to look at how many have developed from her company or business.
remember this woman can have a family, brothers and relatives she helps, when a problem arises those who depend on her become main victims, therefore we should not laugh or celebrate, look at yourself if, the same happens to you how would things be?
when a fellow woman gets a problem pray that she overcomes it, because when you fight you reduce the number of successful groups.
I conclude by saying sure women can.

Nelson Mandela farmers main market located in Mazwi Ward, Sumbawanga Municipality in Rukwa region has burned down the previous night and caused great losses.
the fire that lasted over eight hours exploded at seven o'clock on Saturday night and consumed shops and business sheds within that market that is the second largest and most famous market in Sumbawanga town after the main market located in Mazwi Ward.
the exploding of that fire created great annoyance to the residents of that town.
the market borders with the Nelson Mandela Stadium that has not suffered any damage.
some of the witnesses told this newspaper that many products including clothes, poultry, refrigerators and fruits were burned, while the majority of victims allegedly had no insurance for their business, while the capital was borrowed from various financial institutions.
speaking to the newspaper at the accident scene, Sumbawanga municipal mayor, Justine Malisawa said the fire exploded seven at night and continued raging until midnight and resulted in a significant loss in which young people pretending to be good Samaritans were stealing the property.
"the market is owned by the Sumbawanga municipality, which officially started in 2011, it is also a major source of domestic revenue, its burning has caused a huge loss to the municipality, as we were collecting between 700,000 and one million shillings a day," said the mayor, the firefighters delayed to arrive.
I give special thanks to the police force who managed to control the petty criminals who were continuing with looting in the market, the source of the fire has not been known and admitted that the market had no insurance.
Sumbawanga District Commissioner, Doctor Halfani Haule said the disaster committee would evaluate the actual losses caused by the fire and the initial plans were to transfer the businesspeople of the market at the sites that were reserved in Majengo, Sabasaba, Sabato and Kizwite market.
the regional police commander, George Kyando said no one was arrested for looting incidents that took place within the market that night.
know ways of getting friends.
every time I write about friendship I always remember an incident of two military friends.
their squad went to war, were attacked and came back to their camp with bodies of the dead and with many injured.
one of the friend was saddened because he did not see his colleague friend even though he searched for him among all the dead and the injured.
he was saddened and went to the commander of the troop to request to go back to the battle ground to search for his friend.
the commander replied by saying, "there is no need because you won't find your friend alive.
you may even lose your life."
nevertheless, that young man continued insisting on his mission until the commander allowed him.
he went there and upon returning, he was in a critical condition.
when the commander asked whether he saw his friend he said, "I have found him in a critical state and he is about to die.
when he saw me, he looked at me with tears flowing, he held my hand and said, "I knew you my friend, will come to see me before I close my eyes.
now that you've come, I will die in piece.
then he died while holding my hand.
even though after that, I was saddened in my heart, I didn't feel. the incident of two friends.

the project has been created to control Tanzania and Malawi border in the year on July 19th 2012.
to the citizens who flood is part of their lives, and sometimes their nationality are forcefully change by the river, to the process which enable them to fight with that calamity is the salvation in their lives.
floods are among the effects of climate change, in the country, one of the areas which is often affected by this is the Kyela district in Mbeya province and in the neighboring country Malawi's Karonga district, which borders Kyela on the Tanzania side.
the news from both two government, Malawi and Tanzania, it shows that approximately 52,000 people who lives down the valley of river Songwe in both countries, they have been affected by floods which come out frequently in that area.
but despite the flood problem, citizens living in the River Songwe valley basin, down on both sides of both countries have been facing the problem of evacuation and their settlements caused by the nature of River Songwe that keeps shifting during spring rains.
river Songwe behavior of changing its course now and then for decades now has brought discomfort to the two countries Malawi and Tanzania where in doing so the citizens that are in those flooded areas find themselves in the opposite side of their country thus avoiding the question of their citizenship which is if it's the earlier one or the forced one.
experts in environmental science have concluded that the river's behavior of changing its course has largely been contributed to by the destruction of its surroundings, felling of trees, clearing of bushes and indigenous growths on the river banks and crop farming to the river beds.
it's been explained that human activities have contributed to the exposure of river banks that easing soil erosion during heavy rains where water currents forces the river to change its course and penetrate further either in Tanzania or Malawi.
citizens of both sides haven't been sure with their levity, especially when heavy rains approach, and moreover they don't understand even the events that will befall them in the following rain season, for all these years they've lived in dependence of God's mercy.
while the people are still in those conflicts, Tanzania and Malawi governments have come up with solutions to problems faced by their citizens as well as the borders of the two countries, it's a step towards establishing a joint venture development program for the Songwe river basin.
in addition to the main the aim of that plan, was to strengthen the borders of the two countries which are in Mto Songwe so as to prevent the haphazard changes of the river caused by its perennial nature, the plan will also have many economic and social benefits, to the citizens who lives to the valley on both sides of the two countries.
several steps have already been implemented by the two governments since the commencement of its process around the year 2001, when a feasible study was done under the sponsorship of Norway through NORPLAN's organization.
the countries have now made huge progress whereby this week on Monday in Kyela town, they launched a detailed review of Songwe River development project which will be implemented over a period of two years from 2012 to 2014.
the Minister for Transport, Doctor Harrison Mwakyembe, explained the importance of the project as a deliverer for citizens living along the River Songwe Basin, who for decades have been affected by the floods as well as unproductive farming.
the Songwe River Basin project is expected to make changes in the economic, social development and the lives of the people in general.
Doctor Mwakyembe points out the catalyst of change in the lives of the people as investing in economic projects as well as the presence of a good environment in the use of water in the basin.
the talks between these two countries about how to solve the problems facing those countries at the River Songwe basin began in the ninety seventies, where several basic issues were implemented including agreements, project feasibility, proper placement of the MoU on the implementation of the project and financing.
initially, the launch was to be conducted by the Minister of Water, Professor Jumanne Maghembe, who was stuck in the Katavi region, where it is said he went to participate in party activities.
however, Minister Maghembe arrived in the evening when the launch operations were completed. thus, he continued with the other activities including providing water wells worth 60 million shillings for the people of Mungano Ward.
the project's Secretary General and Ministry of Water, Christopher Sayi, stated that the main purpose of the project was to control the flow of River Songwe which serves as the boundary between the two countries, Malawi and Tanzania, and that the control will help strengthen the border of the two countries (border stabilization).
in his speech during the launch of the project in Kyela town, engineer Sayi mentioned that some of the objectives were to control the floods that have been torturing the citizens who live at the lower region of River Songwe's valley for several decades now.
according to the project's professional report, there will be built three long dams in three different places which will gather water from River Songwe.
in the expert's news it has been confirmed that, the construction of those three dams, will add benefit to the project for citizens living at the valley of River Songwe, which is among the production of electricity, irrigation farming and fishing activities.
the extra profit from that project is among with improving road, incite tourist activities and maintenance for environment of valley for river Songwe.
engineer Sayi confirmed that what is happening in that process of project which was formed recently, is the keen survey of the project and that their major purpose was to remove for them poverty the citizens who lives in that valley.
the opinion of the sponsors of the project, keen survey for the project that is being implemented by the department of African Water facility AWF through African Development Bank, which have 3,549,000 Euros and the new partnership for Africa's Development Infrastructure Project Facility (NEPAD-IPPF) have 1,226,295 Euros, whereby the beneficiary countries: Tanzania contributed 596,610 and Malawi 407,610 Euros.
the AFDB representative, Daniel Verdeil is explaining the importance of the project as being more than just controlling the border and that it goes along with the green development that was launched by the United Nations recently.
Verdeil, who is an expert of AFDB water resource management, says the Songwe River Development Project will also assist in dealing with climate change and will stimulate further development through electricity, agriculture and fishing projects, and will expand employment further.
he refers to electricity production projects that directly affect climate change in which greenhouse gases can be controlled, to reduce dependence on fuel and fuel consumption.
Verdeil mentions irrigation farming will allow citizens living in the valley to deal with climate change due to the farming being one of the strategies to reduce the effects resulting from drought and flooding.
despite the positive attitude of the donors on the project, Malawi's minister of water and irrigation, Ritchie Muheya, urged the African Development Bank to continue receiving the applications of the two countries on the project until its objectives are completed.
he said, the project is a sign of the major relations existing between the two countries.
the head of Mbeya region, Abbas Kandoro, on the other hand, noted that the project is beneficial to most of his province's citizens due to five provinces out of seven of that region being in the project.
these districts have been mentioned including Kyela, Ileje, Mbeya rural, Mbozi and Rugwe, due to the fact that Kandoro has urged citizens in those districts to be good participants in order to achieve the project and avoid establishing unemployment disputes.
already, citizens, especially in Kyela district, have started getting hope in combating floods which are among the effects of climatic changes, as well as River Songwe's trend of changing its course during every short rain season.
Minister Shamsa misleads Parliamentary Committee speaker May 31, 2012
speaker of parliament, Samuel Sitta, said the Land Committee, Natural Resources and Environment, led by Kongwa MP, Job Ndugai, made a mistake to agree with the Minister of Natural Resources and Tourism on a decision that had been made to interfere with the legislature's mandate and mandate to extend the scope of the hunting blocks ownership contrary to the original resolutions of the institution.
according to the Speaker, what should be done is that the Chairman of the Committee gives a quick report to the Parliamentary Committee at least so that it can use its discretion on the issue and the Standing Committee of Parliament doesn't decide to go against parliamentary resolutions.
the commentary of the Speaker is based on the recent event of the Kwela MP, Doctor Chrisant Mandakaya, to submit a personal argument to the parliament requesting the Parliament to issue alternative resolutions against the steps of Minister of Natural Resources and Tourism, Shamsa Mwangunga, to interfere with Parliament's rights and powers.
Mwagunga was required to increase the ownership of the hunting blocks that his expiry should end this year.
he added that time with more than three years, when Parliament already announced that the deadline would end this year in accordance with the original contracts of the owners to reorganize the process of redistribution should be done.
in his defence on the issue, Minister Mwangunga told Parliament that he had changed the decision after submitting the grounds for doing so on the Land Committee, Natural Resources and Environment, on January 12, this year since the Assembly meeting was not yet started.
the Assembly meeting began on January 27, this year.
after Minister Mwangunga submitted his proposal to the committee, the committee agreed with the matter that the Committee had interfered with the Parliament's right and authority because it had agreed with the decision without submitting that argument to the parliament so that the Parliament would probably dismiss its original resolutions.
but also in their defence, the committee through its chairperson, Job Ndugai, claims that it could not submit the statement to the parliament because the Minister had to make a decision to extend the time before the major Nevada hunting conference in the United States where he announced to the block owners that the period had been extended three more years and wrote them a letter.
however, in his comment to good Citizen, the Speaker said if there was an emergency and weighty issue, wisdom should be applied to the Ndugai Committee to submit the information of the Minister to the Parliamentary Leadership Committee.
the Parliamentary Leadership Committee is composed of the Speaker, Deputy Speaker, the Chairman of the Parliament and all the chairman of the Standing Committee of Parliament.
this is the highest organ of Parliament that makes decisions on various issues relating to the conduct of the Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Tanzania.
the wishes that should be applied in this regard, especially from the Land Committee, Natural Resources and Environment, to determine that there is an initial resolution of the Parliamentary Assembly, is to present the actual situation in the Management Committee.
but this is something that should be done if there are basic causes and it happens very rarely, said the Speaker and added that:
I do not believe in the state the Minister was advised to do this (interfere with the constitutional rights and values).
however, as I explained in Parliament, the Minister apologized to the Assembly and it has been satisfied and even a person gave the element in his argument that Parliament would appeal to the Minister.
among the emerging debate on parliamentary members supporting the decision of Minister Mwangunga to extend the ownership period of the blocks is that the State may be charged if it does not implement the decision because it has already informed the owners.
but this argument is severely opposed by some members who have reached the point of demanding hunting operations to be completely eliminated because the country does not benefit adequately.
Kigoma North MP Kabwe Zitto, is surprised to claim that the government will be charged but emphasizes that it will not be the first time the government will be charged.
the government was charged after breaking its contract with the City Water company and was charged and eventually fined but the Government broke a contract with Richmond.
so making a favorable decision to the nation is a fundamental issue, emphasizes Kabwe.
some of the controversies seen in parliament claim that some MPs have benefited from goals of wanting the block owners to be added more time.
it is alleged that some MPs and Ministers have benefited most of them aiming at collecting money with a view to ensuring victory in the polls of their party in the year.
but it is also alleged that some in the tourist hunting sector are among the group of corrupt suspects who have planned to collect money for ensuring that the strong parliamentary members are fall in the polls this year and that the addition of ownership period of the blocks is part of the revenue to achieve the strategy.
when George Bush ordered the prostitute hanged
July 17, 2013
today we continue with this incident that George Bush eventually ordered prostitute Karla (23) hanged in America.
police investigator Houston station America, Mosier met with Douglas who was with his lover Kari Burell the sister of the prostitute Karla Faye the day that followed and here for just a reminder, Kari Burell and Douglas McAndrew Garrett married each other later.
they explained to him that the younger of Douglas called Danny Garrett and the younger of the lover (Kari) called Karla Faye were involved with that murder.
they mentioned James Leibrant to have witnessed that murder.
after being persuaded by the police investigators, Douglas accepted to put on a special recording equipment to collect more evidence for that case and few days later Douglas went to the home of Karla at the McKean Houston estate.
when he arrived he found Danny Garrett and Karla Faye and after a short while, they started talking about the murder they had committed bragging that they have become famous.
those conversations were recorded in the equipment Douglas carried.
the same day after leaving the home of Karla, Douglas took the tape that recorded those conversations to the police then Garrett and Karla were arrested to be charged.
but not just them but James Liebert and Ronnie Burrell also were arrested in order to help investigation on that case.
perhaps before continuing you can ask yourself more this way who is this Karla Tucker Faye?
why did her case attract the sentiments of many people not just in America but also in the rest of the world?
these stadiums managers are the sources of conflict
there is nothing as annoying as these stadiums managers giving an example those for the national stadium in the city of Dar es Salaam.
what I want to say is their habit of delaying to open the gates of the stadium.
they wait to open the gates at two in the afternoon, if that is not looking for chaos, then what is it!
I remember about some past Simba and Yanga matches, the gates were opened at ten in the morning and people got in as they wanted.
it was nice, opening the gates at one or two in the afternoon, here they want those riots so that they throw their bombs and ask for their bribes.
I think we should go back to the era of national stadium manager, Hassan Chabanga Dyamale opening the stadium at 4:00 in the morning and police are there from the start to the end.
these managers are a disregardful.

am arguing with the children of our presidents
March 06, 2014
I have read from the newspaper (no a good citizen), Ridhwani, the child of President Kikwete, complaining that he is hounded and accused of many things.
"the time my elderly father was getting into politics (vying for president) I met with Abdallah Mwinyi (the child of the retired President, Elder Mwinyi), and he told me the challenges that I will meet with as a child of the president, and now I am witnessing them."
those are the words of Ridhiwani quoted on the newspaper I read.
I do not write this article to target Ridhwani or to accuse him on anything.
I want to put things into perspective and speak against the children of our presidents.
I do not oppose Ridhwani that when you are the child of the president you face many challenges.
is the truth, the reason the president is the leader of the country.
every eye is focused on the president and that way all those surrounding him must be focused on.
for that reason it is a must and is important to stay "right".
even so I do not accept that when you are the child of the president especially in our nation of Tanzania you must be hounded and accused!
I support my argument as follows.
our nation up to today have been led by four presidents.
and by good luck our presidents have children.
and starting with Mzee Mwinyi mentioned by Ridhwani, I have not heard of any child of Mzee Mwinyi being trapped and accused falsely because his father was president.
if there is someone who heard the children of Mzee Mwinyi being targeted and accused to come out and testify.
I have surety that these children have their works, they have business and other activities but I have not gotten to hear their activities being linked to their father's position.
Mzee Mwinyi's wife, Mama Siti was trapped and accused falsely of many issues including claims that she used her husband's name to do business.
even so after a deep investigation and comparing with what happened after Mzee Mwinyi coming from government people realized that Mama Siti was mistreated.
the truth is that Mzee Mwinyi when in power none of his children were targeted and accused for doing business or having excessive wealth.
even so, I have heard in the estates that his other child, who is now a minister, Hussein Mwinyi, is being blamed for "opening wide" on the road with a car when going to work from his home.
people questioned: if the minister stretches apart and is defeated to follow the laws of the road what will other people do?
and the truth is that "when he stretches apart" and other people will follow his behind.
even so this behavior of "stretching apart" on the road it not because this is a child of the retired president but is his behavior as himself.
children of Mwalimu Nyerere are all still alive.
I did not get to hear the time of the reign of Mwalimu Nyerere that any of his child being targeted and accused because his father is the president of the nation.
furthermore, I have not heard claims that these children have excessive wealth.
if anyone got to hear I request that he come out and testify.
even after Mwalimu's retirement until his death in October 14, 1999, I have not heard any of Mwalimu's children mentioned in dirty affairs.
the children of Mwalimu Nyerere went to normal schools after living a totally normal life in the society.
even today they continue living a totally normal life.
it's my belief that even they will run their life by doing business and other activities but I have not heard of them being targeted or of any pointed fingers at any dirty affairs.
it is open that the children of the presidents will be getting their challenges the time their father was in power but those of being targeted and accused of owning excessive wealth or involving themselves with dirty affairs of corruption and others of the same I have not heard.
retired President Benjamin William Mkapa also have children.
I have not heard at the time of his reign any of his child being targeted and accused of dirty affairs.
if am not wrong there are many Tanzanians who know even the names of the children of elder Mkapa.
those names did not decorate the headings of the newspapers or they did not join politics and also they did not use their father's name for anything.
if there is anyone who thinks am saying a lie then to come out to remove his testimony.
if am not wrong the child our presidents who have been heard of more in the media and the one who have been targeted and accused of many issues is Ridhwani Kikwete.
I do not like to believe that he is targeted because he is the child of the president.
14,000 recruits to be educated yearly.
by Mwangi Muiruri
the Central Government has announced that they will be educating 14,000 recruits in the national youth service (NYS) yearly on potato farming.
the announcement was made yesterday by the Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Agricultural prosperity, Miss Ann Onyango, during the inauguration of the project at the NYS college in Ruaraka, Nairobi county.
this project will be made possible through the cooperation of NYS and the National Potato Council of Kenya (NPCK).
Miss Onyango said that this project will also profit 1,500 field officers as well as 1,200 recruits yearly, who will be given the option to choose to work as agricultural officers after graduating.
she said that this will give Kenya a bigger platform to harvest food through technology and new ideas learned by the officers.
Miss Onyango said the benefit of the memorandum of understanding is that NYS will be educating the recruits yearly and in turn they will be able to earn money from the agricultural project.
"the department of NYS will be a seller of potatoes and its seedlings at the market in order to get money," she said.
furthermore, after graduating and joining national building, the NYS recruits will be well equipped with knowledge of participating in agriculture in the community, therefore, increasing the national potato harvest.
Miss Onyango urged other institutions like the prisons service, universities and other higher learning institutions to sign such memorandum of understanding so as to gain extra money and lessen the burden of purchasing food from the market.
the NPCK director, Mister Naftaly Kaguongo said that potatoes is the second agriculture in the country whose benefits are seen first hand in public nutrition.
he said that for now, that farming has attracted more than three million farmers while contributing as a whole 40 billion shillings as national revenue.
"either, potato farming helps 800,000 Kenyans to earn a living in the hotel, wine and juice sectors," he said.
political rebellion is a democratic right July 16, 2012.
the year 1958 shall be remembered in the history of African redemption meeting of All-African People's Conference that was held in Accra Ghana under the chairmanship of Kwame Nkrumah a lawyer of every African citizen (Pan-Africanism).
the meeting was very important since it's one that cast out Patrice Lumumba and made him famous outside his bordering country Congo.
at that time Lumumba had already begun to gain fame in his country in the movement of fighting Belgium colonialism but internationally more far in the countries that were colonized by the British he was not known.
one thing that many are forgetting is the argument that emerged in the meeting between Nkrumah with delegates from South Africa where Nelson Mandela with his partners who were fighting magic rule.
those conflicts were involved in which methods used to eliminate colonialism and imperialism in Africa.
delegates from South Africa insisted that the only method to be used was the one for weapons fight against colonialists.
they questioned that doing otherwise would never conquer colonial rule or minority rule.
Nkrumah had another plea.
being one of the head preachers of African socialism, Nkrumah was also a democratic system activist.
Nkrumah understood the meaning of democracy and as he quotes that the democracy has to be one of the shield for Pan Africanism.
in this way, he wasn't attracted to the idea of using force in fighting colonization despite being that democracy was the system of administration of western governments that had exploited African countries for a period of six centuries.
Nkrumah believing that, the relationship between democracy and the struggles of fighting colonization and imperialism are inseparable.
therefore it's healthy for one to be anti colonialism or imperialism and at the same time to be opposed to democracy.
that is impossible.
furthermore he understood that, nothing was going against democracy more than colonialism and imperialism.
that's the same as saying that, a person with a heart of democracy is what makes him to continue having courage for fighting imperialism and colonialism.
I believe that one of the mistakes of African leaders after their countries got independence, is to throw away the idea of democracy instead of making it an important pillar of the activities of bringing development of the African social philosophy.
what confuses and worries us is seeing that, Nkrumah was among the first leaders who slide when they step on the democracy peel.
it's Nkrumah who continues to use, for example, that law of colonization for putting people in the dock without taking them first to court, the law that even here in our place was use to manipulate the opposition.
and it is also Nkrumah who changed the constitution of the country and made Ghana a one-party state which was his Convention Peoples Party (CPP).
Nkrumah wanting to introduce a new governmental system that doesn't copy that Westminster democracy that is followed by Britain and many countries that were in the past colonized by her.
he argued that the democratic system that allows many parties is a system that divides the society and did not have any productivity for young countries like Ghana.
Nkrumah did not say that the democratic system governance is bad but he criticized that which permits existence of many parties.
and he firmly believes that democracy can grow in a regime system that justifies the existence of only one political party.
wanting the new kind of democracy, a democracy whose seed will be planted and grow on African soil, a democracy that will have roots in the history and environment of African traditions.
unfortunately, those kinds of thoughts went astray.
we have witnessed in much in Africa, even in our places, how the one- party system undermined democracy by violating fundamental human rights and slowing down the development.
disregarding the democracy affecting the economic strategies of countries with a system that allowed only one legitimate party.
the situation gave a platform to unjust leaders, dictators, to misuse their country's resources because there were no democratic ways to make them accountable.
additionally, there was no transparency in the operation and implementation of economic activities.
there is no doubt that democracy is an integral part of the development process in the African continent.
those who say that democracy doesn't fill the stomach are mistaken.
democracy can ensure the stomachs of Africans are full, as long as other development criteria are followed in ways that give justice to all citizens.
democracy can fill the stomachs as it can greatly help in efforts to alleviate poverty in society.
I do not say that it is a simple task or that all communities with a truly democratic system have been able to alleviate poverty.
what I am saying is that democracy can be a shield to enable communities to protect themselves from corruption, misappropriation of public funds and lack of accountability from leaders.
the important thing is that democracy also hinders strong people in society whether political or economic power, they will not be able to abuse those powers without being accountable to the law.
when democracy is serving that purpose, then it is more likely to achieve economic and social development.
it is easy to understand why a loud whistle has been blown in Africa to oppose democracy and see it as a Western ideology, used hypocritically by the West to oppress the African continent.
it is true from time to time western countries have been using an excuse of democracy in plotting conspiracy of ejecting African leaders from their positions who go against the interests of their countries, as they did it to Nkurumah and more recently Mua'mmar Qadhafi of Libya.
it is also true from time to time the same western countries have been tolerant and protecting African leaders who were brutal and were not following true democracy or even false ones like Mobutu Sese Seko.
until this day western countries, led by America, still continue with their style of supporting and protecting dictatorial leaderships because they are their friends.
and these dictatorial leaders are their friends when they are using their own interests in those western countries while cause disturbance, stealing and looking down upon their fellow citizens.
when we are speaking and reviewing democracy it is very important to remember that democracy is not just one thing only but it is a mixture of many things.
the previous thing is that citizens should have ability to decide their own things, therefore the administrative authority is in their hands.
they should have judiciary powers that comes from the constitution and has the ability to remove the leaders whom they don't want from their positions.
among the others that are needed so as real democracy can grow is freedom of press, freedom of gathering, freedom of religion that a person wants in addition to freedom of not worshiping any religion, freedom of getting information from anywhere, freedom of speech, availability of human rights together with the right of citizenship and the right not to interfere with personal issues in public.
all that will not be enough to make democracy to be real if there will be no equality among the citizens, if there is no respect, tolerance and having reconciliation in families.
a lot of people when they speak about democracy they give priority to election.
they see election as the foundation of democracy.
surely, election has a foundation in democracy only when it is done in fairness.
the election of this kind gives citizen freedom to choose whom they want without any uncertainty of any kind from the Commonwealth leadership.
in short, in real democracy, there must be elections that are done in integrity.
it is not enough to have a system of democracy.
what is needed in most of the African countries is to have institutions that will be able to prevent democratic roots from being easily uprooted.
if such institutions are missing then it becomes very easy to kill the democratic system.
we are witnessing that in Mali where after the existence of a democratic system for twenty years only one soldier, Captain Amadou Haya Sanogo killed democracy and drowned the country in disaster.
history teaches us that when there is a lack of true democracy, it is not unusual to see hostilities rising, spiritual conflicts, and even bloody battles.
where there is true democracy there is a state of peace, security, and tranquility in society.
in the same way, when there's an injustice or complains in the democratic community has its own ways of making the oppressed to be able to remove their doubts of asking for their rights.
another major benefit of democracy is that it enables people to expand their thinking.
it liberates the people and gives them freedom of thinking, freedom of action and even going against ancient thinking.
for the community to continue and have a democratic democracy, it's important for citizens to have freedom to compromise politics and to have thoughts that doesn't follow the current of normal thinking of the community members.
the right to political rebellion is a fundamental and democratic right.
there is a high possibility that Kenya may be allowed to grow GMO maize.
by James Kariuki
possibly Kenya may start to plant Genetically Modified Maize (GMO) if the trials that are continuing will get approval from the National Bio-Safety Authority (NBA).
this development is a result of the issuance of permits by the NBA to the Kenya agricultural and research organization (KALRO) and another non-government organization, Africa Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF), to lead the national plan on the growing of GMO maize in the whole country.
but the head of the NBA Doctor Willy Tonui warned that those trials are to get maize that will be tried first if they are safe for Kenyans to eat or have a poison that is feared causes the disease of cancer.
earlier, KALRO and AATF asked for a permit to grow that maize and sell in the market but they were denied until when government researchers will do more trials to find out if that maize is safe for use and also doesn't damage the environment.
Doctor Tonui said the permit will be given after the environmental authority in the country has done a proper investigation on all farms, that will be used and finally to give the permit.
the NBA said that GMO maize needs more research, and warned that the maize will be planted on the farms belonging to the Kenya plant health inspectorate (KEPHIS) under tight security and added that possibly the permit, may be removed if the GMO researchers go against those rules.
the NBA permit was received with rejoicing by supporters of GMO maize because possibly, crop production may increase and help Kenyans deal with hunger but those who believe they are harmful to health are opposed.
in his statement, Doctor Tonui said that the GMO maize will be studied more to inspect its structure and to ensure they have no chemicals and are safe for human consumption, or to ban that maize if it will be found with dangerous chemicals.
earlier, KALRO and AATF asked for permission to plant seeds and to distribute them in the whole country, saying they are safe and their research has shown that Kenya needs to distribute the knowledge of strengthening planting of maize through scientific means in order to deal with the problem of hunger.
UNESCO General Director's message celebrates the world's Sayansi day
the World Science Day for Peace and Development in 2016 is "Celebrating Centers and Museums of Science".
our beginning is clear
Sayansi continues to be the main pillar of the 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development, Addis Ababa agenda is to take a strategy for Sendai Disaster Risk Strategy, and Paris Convention on climate change.
all these agreements provide a new thought of peace and prosperity of the world, to empower having a community that builds and exchanges knowledge to continue discovery and innovation with an aim to ensure the existence of sustainable and joint development in the future.
in order to achieve this, further expansion of the Sayansi industry is needed to ensure the presence of positive relations between Sayansi and society.
this is the main reason why centers and museums of Sayansi are essential for building capacity, defending and transmitting messages on the importance of Sayansi in sustainable development.
centers and museums of Sayansi together have a major role in nurturing the curiosity of men and women, as a creative laboratory to stimulate research and to help the community cope with its challenges.
in this digital era, the time we need creative efforts to promote Sayansi studies outside classes, centers and museums of Sayansi are key to helping that.
they provide an appropriate way to motivate children especially for girls to study Sayansi studies to enhance the potential and scientific efficiency.
in November 2015, UNESCO welcomed the world's proposal to maintain and develop museums and its publications, its other documents and its responsibilities before the community, to strengthen our wish of mobilizing the museum as an important element of peace and sustainable development.
in the celebrations of this year of World Science Day in Peace,
we cooperate with the Association of Science -Technology Centers and the international Council of Museums in this regard, aiming at developing and distributing scientific knowledge throughout the world.
centers and museums of Sayansi are key platforms for dialogue to be able to understand and be able to cope with various issues.
they offer sparkles of Joy and wonders that move foreigners regardless of age or nature, by providing experiences that bring together women and men of the same moral values.
in this regard, I invite all the partners together with governments around the world to integrate power into developing centers and museums for the purpose of having a sustainable development.
16 bodies recovered from the ship that sunk recently
by AFP
Gajaria, Bangladesh
divers from the navy recovered the bodes of 16 people from the ship that sunk in Bangladesh.
officials said the number of the people that died from drowning had reached 45.
two ships succeeded in recovering that ship that had sunk and took it nearer to the shore, that's when divers succeeded to search for those who had drowned 90 feet (30 meters).
waves had hit the ship that sunk three days ago.
"we have completed the exercise at recovering bodies inside the ship.
"officers from the navy who are divers have searched for survivors everywhere after the sunk ship floated," Bangladesh's Chief Maritime Officer Mister Shamsuddoha Khandaker told the AFP news agency.
"up until now those who died from drowning were 45."
we have searched everywhere and there is a possibility that no more bodies will be found," a chief government official in the area Mister Saiful Hasan told AFP.
chief of police in the area Mister Ferdous Ahmed confirmed the number of dead.
Hasan said that, search operations for more bodies in the River Meghna which is the widest in the world, would continue as some of the bodies might have been swept by waves to the river.
reports say that the ship had carried 350 people but when it started its journey to the South of Bangladesh the number was reduced to 150-200.
leaders are contemplating before making a decision
the criteria of good leadership are many and cannot be counted with the fingers.
but some of those criteria are fundamental and if one of them has a shortcoming, the reputation of a better leadership that is just and legal, staggers, breaks down or completely disintegrate.
among the important criteria of good leadership is to have a system of leadership and a judicial process that is known without controversy and not one that changes like the weather condition at the Indian Ocean.
when there is a doubt which eventually leads to a person's ignorance of the future or the release of an advertisement from now on, this is unacceptable, then the good governance becomes increasingly unfounded and unreasonable.
nowadays in the country, even weather forecasters cannot predict when the sun goes down in the evening and rise tomorrow morning, what incident will transpire!
we recently experienced police force in the country developing many coastal areas and its centers by installing investment centers.
businesspersons who wanted to use those areas were invited and many showed up to be given those sections and eventually a couple of them were given and they abandoned the contracts that were exploiting them.
immediately after the workers were given those sections, they did great transformation including installing various equipment such as air conditioners that are needed for their businesses.
however, we are suddenly getting news that the giving out of those sections to private businesspersons results in insecurity.
Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs, Yusuf Masauni arrived in Zanzibar and demanded that the shops which were given to businesspersons in various areas close to the police stations to be taken back and be refunded their monies for rent.
there emerge many issues, but the most important is that security of the nation being addressed here, why was it not seen the whole time and even when it was decided to be allocated to private traders to undertake their ventures?
another issue that needs to be addressed here is that there are contract agreements for renting the shops and because the contract is being terminated, will there be payments to compensate for that decision that disregards the contracts? and who will decide the amount of cash compensated?
requiring these businesspersons to close down the shops and take out their commodities is not just because many do not have a place to keep them.
it should also be remembered that most of them used millions of shillings to construct those shops and majority were given the fields and used millions of shillings on construction.
refunding these traders money for rent alone is being unfair to them.
those shops are now packed with commodities including those bought on credit.
will the police force buy those products by considering that when these individuals are chased away they don't have an alternative place to sell them.
some of the traders who are supposed to be evacuated are those who had been expelled from the Darajani region of Unguja last year and encountered losses of millions of shillings.
now while settling after getting an alternative place to continue with their lives, they are told, "move out immediately!"
surely, if this is not abuse, then what is it?
the Ministry of Internal affairs should seriously consider its point of wanting to oust businessmen whom it welcomed and suddenly it wants them displaced claiming that they are not required in those sections.
this action causes people to build up a notion that our laws exist in name only and that those deals can be reversed at any time by those wielding power and authority.
this is not a good system of governance and it gives confidence to those who recently joined to argue that nowadays the government makes a decision without regard to the law and the circumstances of life of its people.
when an order is given to break the house, they no longer have patience to care about those with small children.
furthermore, this trend discourages investors as they will always not be sure if after spending a lot of money to put up a project they maybe told at any time to close up their stakes and leave immediately.
other times you hear that such move was considered as they lacked patriotism or their presence would endanger national security.
sometimes such a decision is not exactly the order of the government directly, but it comes from an individual leader and who do so for reasons known to him.
it is good to build a culture that assures safety to entrepreneur's money that he has invested and not have a system whereby investors seem to guess and that there is no guarantee for the security of their money.
if we do not cease this trend of haphazardness and orders we will find ourselves requiring local and foreign businessmen to invest, but no one will respond to our call because there is no guarantee of financial security.
we must have a system of law that is clear and that cannot be set aside or turned upside down by orders from the leaders on grounds of national security or public interests.
good governance is not managed by orders or instructions from leaders.
this is not an era of a leader waking up one morning to say, "from today this and that ban is legitimate."
leaders are required to abide by the existing law and not legislate what they see appropriate for our country.
if we have a law that we see has a weakness to be amended or if we want to formulate a new law then it is the work of Parliament and the House of Representatives and not the leader.
these days, even kings and sultans have abandoned the dictatorial style of leadership.
many of them nowadays use the legislative bodies whose representatives have been chosen by the people in one way or another.
this is because it is acceptable and there is no dispute that it's the public that dictates how the country is to be rule and that is why they are called citizens, implying those who own the country.
leaders are just workers for citizens who carry out those things that they (citizens or the country) want done at that time and in future.
in the event of an authoritative leader who uses powers that interests him is labeled a dictator, that is one who gives orders and demand it implemented as does a school teacher during a dictation class.
students just write what is being pronounced by the teacher and they do not have a right to ask a question or hesitate.
this is what led to this kind of leadership and no matter the type of cosmetics used on it for it to be attractive, it is still called dictatorial governance.
we do mistakes and we should accept by correcting and having a system of governance that is open, proactive and judicial and not leaders who every day chatter on this and that or give orders to this or the other to be dealt with because he is not "our colleague."
let us allow the laws that we formulated to do its work and those who violate them be legally dealt with by those mandated with the responsibility of implementing the various laws that we instituted in our country.
among institutions that society expects to be at the forefront to ensure that it does things legally and not to be lead by orders, as we have in the police force parade.

Africa can't escape donations - Kikwete.
Harieth Makweta, Citizen, hmakweta@mwananchi.co.tz.
Dar es Salaam. the forth term president Jakaya Kikwete has said that African countries can't escape donations from European countries because those donations are their historical responsibility.
Kikwete said that yesterday during the launch of a two day meeting discussing 17 new objectives of the United Nations that concern 'sustainable development for 2030'.
the meeting has put efforts to discuss the 16th objective that urges rights, peace and associative societies, especially in legal governance issues as the yeast to sustainable development.
Kikwete said that duty is supposed to be continued because the development of European countries came from the resources they took from Africa during the colonial period.
he said the African countries have enough natural resources and therefore, for them to work, there is still need for investment which will uplift industries and grow the economy of the African countries, and without that, it will take a long time to reach far economically.
however, he said African countries must put in place procedures on how to receive those donations, but the aim should be to benefit the locals and by following the laws of the countries and international ones.
"the donations we're talking about do not have to be financial, but we need them to invest more in legal contracts that protect the locals. for example, we have enough natural resources in Tanzania like gas, minerals and others but all these need to be extracted and processed.
we must give them a chance to effect but through laws that will protect Tanzanians," said Kikwete.
that statement from Kikwete comes after the fifth term President John Magufuli has already put a stand in his several speeches, urging Tanzania to be self-dependent by a huge percentage instead of relying on foreign aid.
while putting the foundation stone to a flyover at the junction of Mandela and Nyerere roads in TAZARA areas, President Magufuli called the donors' aid 'mocking bread' saying it is better to eat cassava instead of eating that bread.
even though he didn't clarify or speak in detail about that statement, he made it a few days since the American Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) suspended aid worth 472.8 American dollars, close to 1 trillion shillings on allegations that Tanzania violated democracy principles by repeating the Zanzibar election and failing to manage the cybercrimes law.
also, President Magufuli on March 29th while in Mlimani village, Chato District in Geita Province said that the biggest duty that is ahead of the Tanzanians for now is uniting and being self-reliant in development so that everyone ensures an increase in production and performance at their work place.
"therefore, we must rely on ourselves, and if we do so, everyone should be responsible where ever they are. a worker should should work diligently, a farmer should farm diligently, a trader should trade diligently, a breeder should breed diligently, a fisherman should fish diligently and we will cross over Tanzania," he said.
the meeting was organized by the International Development Law Organization (IDLO) with its headquarters in Italy, whose custodian in Tanzania is the third term retired president, Benjamin Mkapa.
speaking during that meeting, Mkapa said that for any country to develop, there must be a citizens' constitution that will not focus on one group.
"previously, many African countries had no citizens' constitution and instead there was a party's constitution which for now remains in only dictatorial countries. for now, we focused on putting in place policies and strict strategies so as to implement new world objectives under the new United Nations compass of the world's developments," said Mkapa.
the state minister, Office of the President, Service and Good Administration, Angela Kairuki said as it is for African countries' agenda, a country can't have good legal administration if there isn't a good access to the law.
"you must put in place good systems to resolve conflicts too, the issuance of permits without bribes, and even in investment, without good laws protecting that side, it is difficult for investors to be present," said Kairuki.
the executive director of IDLO, Irene Khan said that meeting put efforts to discuss rights, peace and associative societies.
"the objective is to have a new world development compass that focuses on eradicating poverty, protecting the environment, fighting the climatic changes and involving all groups in the society in development matters," said Khan.
'the fruits of online education haven't been seen'
written by Gloria Tesha, Dodoma
published: 07 November 2016
the government has said the fruits of online education haven't been seen on a big level in the country, because many schools don't have computer laboratories.
the Minister of Education, Science, Technology and Technical Training, Professor Joyce Ndalichako, has said in Dodoma City that the government recognizes online education and by cooperating with other stakeholders it will continue to improve that education.
she said this when closing a symposium of education stakeholders in the country, that was hosted by the Institute East African Educational Development of Aga Khan University.
that symposium built on debating the challenges and opportunities of education and gave recommendations to the government.
it enjoined experts of educational issues from government institutes and the private sector together with political leaders, including members of parliament.
she said online education hasn't benefited many students in the country and that condition is a result of the truth that, it's only a few schools that have computer laboratories and many students still can't get educational publications online.
in confronting that problem, she said the government will continue to enjoin private sector stakeholders and others to ensure that online education benefits all students in the country.
"on the part of secondary and primary still we have a few schools that have computer laboratories to enable students to benefit, the government recognizes this and we are involving more stakeholders so that students can benefit with openness," she explained.
the Managing Director of the Institute for Educational Development, East Africa and the Principal of Aga Khan University, Professor Joe Lugalla, said the issue of education development isn't a government one only, rather of all Tanzanians.
he said Tanzanians are required to work by cooperating to bring up challenges and opportunities of education and to work on them.
Obama strives to close Venezuela's Guantanamo Bay prison with restrictions
Washington, USA White House is about to reach its goal of closing the Guantanamo Bay military prison, which has been used to detain terrorists.
and while President Barack Obama has been committed to accelerating the closing process, analysts say he may not be able to close it while in power.
last week, six prisoners were transferred to other areas after being released from the prison.
the six, including four Syrians, a Palestinian and a Tunisian were transferred to Uruguay after serving 13-year prison term.
the move results in the number of prisoners released this year to 19, 13 of them being transferred in a period of one month.
"our position on the prison is due to its activities threatening nationalist security and should be closed," said Patrick Ventrel, a spokesperson for the Security Council.
"US citizens should not be spending hundreds of millions of dollars every year for an institution that affects our relationship with the countries that are our main allies," he said.
Washington, The United States Congress of the United States passed a law that promotes strong restrictions against Venezuela officials linked to human rights violations.
this step is ironical considering that United States is on fire for torturing of terrorist suspects.
the leaders are involved in the support of attacks against protesters who were against the government earlier this year.
thousands of activists were arrested while more than 43 were killed during the protests against President Nicholas Maduro's government, who was elected to replace the late Hugo Chavez.
the protests lasted from Feb to May.
the United States announced traffic disputes against officials in July.
the failure of that rule to make changes in government is the fact that there has been an increase in those obstacles
did JPM establish a corruption judiciary or did he found it?
Elias Msuya, citizen, emsuya@mwananchi.co.tz
among the promises that Doctor John Magufuli promised during the general elections campaign when vying for presidency, is to initiate corruption courts to deal with corruption, theft and bribes in the country.
apart giving that promise during campaigns, President Magufuli talked about the issue during the ultimate day of the new year's Courts week in Dar es Salaam earlier this year, requiring the Chief Justice Othman Chande not to wait for parliament to approve the bill of instituting a corruption's court instead the court to commence work as quickly as possible.
he said, delays in the commencement of that court provides an opportunity for the corrupt individuals to continue wrecking the country and make it poor, yet it has enough resources to run the state without depending on funds from donors which he said have conditions.
President Magufuli insisted on the importance of instituting that court that he wants to be a section of the Supreme Court as the case of lands and business courts.
while closing the commemorations, the president said his intention is to see the country having a good economy that will benefit every Tanzanian from the available resources rather than being owned by few individuals.
recently, Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa announced the launch of that court when presenting the estimates of revenues and expenditures of his office to the parliament in Dodoma.
"concerning that promise of establishing a special corruption court, I would like to inform your parliament that the government has initiated the Bribery and Corruption Division of the Supreme Court, which will commence work in July 2016," Majaliwa said.
the prime minister also said the government will strengthen the office of the director of public prosecution and the office of the attorney general so that together they can accelerate the delivery of justice to the cases that will be presented to that court.
speaking about the cost of that court, Majaliwa said in an effort to deal with the shortage of courtrooms and resources at all levels, President Magufuli has implemented his promise that he gave on February 4, of providing 12.3 billion shillings for purposes of developing the courts.
he said that move has enabled the court to proceed with renovation and construction of the court at various levels together with purchase of equipment.
Majaliwa said the government intends to reduce the nuisance from many court proceedings so that citizens get justice in time.
"the government has also improved and increased efficiency in investigations and conducting of proceedings by separating the investigation and conduction of proceedings roles," said Majaliwa.
Majaliwa said the leadership of the court has scheduled a program for the court's judges to have a target number of cases they are expected to rule over every year.
in the process of constructing a court, the constitution of the United Republic is the basis for the establishment of state authority as government, (Article 34) court (Article 107 A) and the parliament of the United Republic (Article 62).
the judicial department is instituted by the constitution and give the mandate of delivering justice when resolving and determining various issues it has been authorized to address.
there are different types of courts, for instance those directly established by the Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania, Court of Appeal of the United Republic, High Court of the United Republic of Tanzania, High Court of Zanzibar and the Special Constitutional Court of the United Republic.
there are also courts that are being initiated by law which include resident magistrates' courts of 1984:
the resident magistrates' courts, district courts and the initial courts.
the third type is special courts that are initiated under a special law to attend to specific issues, Labor Courts, Children's Court, High Court of Commerce and Lands High Court.
nevertheless, when the government announced the commencement of that court, it has explained that the court was already there but its performance was crippled.
that court was instituted in accordance with the Economic Sabotage Act of the year 1984, being a few years after the Kagera war which disrupted the economy causing a shortage of commodities in the shops.
talking about that court recently, Singida East parliamentarian (Chadema), Tundu Lissu said, that court has been in the country since 1984.
"President Magufuli needs to be reminded that this country has had the corruption court since 1984, that is 31 years ago, when Edward Sokoine was the Prime Minister.
the formulated law is called "the law of controlling economic sabotage crime".
"that law together with other things, constituted the special court of economic sabotage, the corrupt and others," says Lissu.
Lissu says that law is present to date and its violation is addressed by the Institute of Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCB).
nevertheless, he says with the current situation, PCB has been derailed by the ineffective judicial system that prevents it to take a case in court without getting permission from the attorney general.
the vice chairperson of Chadema, Professor Abdallah Safari has applauded the decision to establish that court saying that corruption cases will be given the weight they deserve.
"the problem I'm foreseeing is in big cases being taken to Resident's Magistrate Courts.
when the law of economic sabotage was formulated, the Prime Minister at the time was Sokoine and the President was Julius Nyerere, it was only the High Court that was mandated to hear those cases because they believed it's only the judges who have the ability to preside over them," says Professor Safari.
"later, they came to assign the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) the responsibility of taking those cases to lower courts.
the corruption suspects have great potential, they can bribe even his entire salary without being shaken."
Professor Safari who is among the legal experts in the country says it is important to respect the court so as to eliminate loopholes for bribes.
"in those days, a single case was presided over by three judges. today such a big case is presided over by one magistrate. how can they fail to bribe him?
"it is important that we change that court's status," says Professor Safari.
ministers to continue stretch out with panels May 31, 2012.
among the leaders who will continue to use luxurious vehicles, famous as the squares are ministers and their assistants, is well known.
reports reaching us explain that ministers and assistant ministers will remain in the list of those who will use those vehicles due to the kind of performance in their activities which to a large extent involves trips in the citizens areas, in the villages.
further reports explain that the heads of departments are among the group of cadre which will be affected by this government decision which was officially announced by President Jakaya Kikwete to reduce the number of swarms, including the reduction of the number of vehicles that were expected to be ordered this year.
however, the assistant minister for Infrastructure, Hezekiah Chibulunje, refused to confirm that possibility for now insisting that he will be ready to that after the official copy about the issue is complete and presented in the ministers council.
according to Chibulunje, the ministry currently continues to prepare the copy with the aim of reducing the burden of government spend.
the step taken by the ministry is to implement the instruction of the President, Jakaya Kikwete, that in this financial year, the government will not buy cars as it is normal but instead it will buy few cars which are needed.
the funds that are expected to be saved from that decision by the government have been planned to import tractors so as to develop the agricultural sector in the country that is mentioned to employ more than 80 percent of citizens.
on Monday this week, while answering a question from the member of parliament of special seats, Lucy Owenya (Chadema), Chibulunje said the government has been buying the cars very expensive because of the ministry and its departments.
he defended the procedure saying that type of automobile is stable and can withstand long distances in rural areas, and that since those cars begun to be used in the country in late 1980s, the government has been assessing the cost of using those vehicles.
however, he said together with the stability the operating costs of these cars are double high as soon as they begin to get old.
in his reply, Chibulunje told the members of parliament that the document organized by his ministry would set the procedure for the use of such vehicles in the government by focusing on the position of the leaders.
at the end of last year, while in that meeting with the senior secretaries from various ministries together with the executive director, Philemon Luhanjo, in his office in Dar es Salaa city, the prime minister, Mizengo Pinda noted that the government planned to buy 800 of those expensive cars, and advised that it is mandatory to reduce the number, a step which was later supported by a special order from President Kikwete, in his last speech for the month of January.
is a contest between Shitambala and Mbilinyi
September 23, 2015
with approximately 35 days remaining to vote, the contest in the Mbeya town region has remained between the member of parliament who finished his term, Joseph Mbilinyi, and Sambwee Shitambala.
those two contestants come from inside two major parties and with the greatest rivalry since the last general elections in the year 2010.
those parties are Chadema that is being represented by Mbilinyi and CCM that is being represented by Shitambala.
far from their party rivalry, those contestants themselves also have rivalry considering in the past elections, Shitambala vied for parliament for the region of Mbeya villages where after losing he removed himself and moved to CCM.
Shitambala knows well that his old party and he is quoted as saying, he knows the tactics that were used by that party to win in the last election.
even so, this year's election environment in that region has changed, the enmity that used to be in the party of the revolution is not there again.
political analysts of that region recognize that in this year's election the rivalry is big and there is no easy slope for both the parties like in the past election.
it is a choice that is defined to be more reluctant than any party will spy on.
in the past general election, Mbilinyi was not given a big chance of winning but he benefited from the troubles of CCM in that region where the camp of Thom Mwang'onda is claimed to be unsatisfied with the results of the opinion poll, that way deciding to punish their party by joining Chadema, a step that enabled Mbilinyi to emerge victorious.
despite the crisis benefiting Chadema, the power of his presidential candidate in the polls, Doctor Wilbrod Slaa, is also said to contribute significantly to building the party in the region and the Mbeya Region.
"people believed in Doctor Slaa, he has a great convincing ability he, had great energy and he could order people to do anything and do," says one Chadema leader in Mbeya province but requested his name protected.
there are no such environments this year, that party will be forced to do extra work to succeed in continuing to hold on that region that is among the important regions in the national politics.
the divisions that were in CCM which eased Chadema's capture of that region is not there again and Doctor Slaa is not with that party again.
troubles resulting from opinion polls are affecting both two parties and for Chadema it is their first test they were not used to, a person joined and was given a chance of vying for a parliamentary position without causing divisions.
this time they have entered into the campaign divided again after the opinion polls, those who lost blaming dirty game including the huge usage of money.
in the time Chadema are tackling the discomfort of dispute-based conflicts, their opponents have taken rest, the state of hostility is very different from the previous election.
in developments that even the leaders of that party did not expect groups did not come out after opinion polls and now they are united in the campaign.
the step by members to publicly oppose the coming of some of the politicians from CCM with an aim of being given a chance to contest for leadership, councilor up to the presidency, is message enough that this year, things aren't easy like they were back then.
Mwanjelwa aching the heads of the contestants
among the areas that are causing headaches to the contestants is the business area of Mwanjelwa. it is a more strategic area with influence to other areas of Mbeya.
it is an area that integrates all the city's inhabitants, spending most of their time in the city.
one of the CCM party members who contested to be selected by that part for the parliamentary position, Ulimboka Mwakili, says that if you catch Mwanjelwa, you have also held part of Iyela ward, among the biggest wards in that region with very many voters.
in addition to Iyela, you also get to have a big influence in wards of Luanda Nzovwe, Isanga and Ilemi, wards also with many voters.
in addition to many voters, they are areas whose residents are not people with attachment to parties, but decide according to the persuasion of the contestants, on personality and his ability to tackle challenges.
are unpredictable voters.
Mwanjelwa, particularly the Kabwe area has become a major stronghold of Mbilinyi since the end of the 2010 general election, whereby that Chadema contestant could issue any order and it is implemented, and to reach a step of the government fearing that area.

Chadema answers CCM's issue about Lema's membership of parliament and good leadership
by Goodluck Hongo
the party of democracy and development (Chadema), has said the revolution party (CCM), is supposed to tell Tanzanians the truth about the billions hidden outside the country and the step taken instead of pretending to be the State House and government spokesmen.
the director of communication and campaigns for Chadema who is also Ubongo's member of parliament, Mister John Mnyika said that in Dar es Salaam yesterday while speaking with this newspaper in responding to Mapigoyo CCM that, the winning of Arusha's member of parliament appeal Mister Godbless Lema is a result of good leadership of the party in power.
he said their part once complained to State House about the interruption of Mister Lema's case but whoever answers is CCM.
he wanted Tanzanians to remember that CCM through its cadres are the ones who opened the case to obstruct the interest of Arusha's citizens who elected Mister Lema as their member of parliament and questioned proper governing of the party in power.
"had Chadema not appealed, had lawyers or did not have the ability to fight for citizen's rights about the decision of the Arusha High Court, today Mister Lema would not be the member of parliament for that region," said Mister Mnyika.
he added that it is good CCM stopped propaganda and instead go to the provinces and explain to the citizens how many old politicians have renewed themselves, how many corrupt individuals have they removed from the government and repossessed their property.
"taxpayers money that has been stashed out of the country and it is not only in Switzerland but also in the Mauritius islands, if CCM really wants to go back to God, it should implement this first," he said.
he said according to the constitution, the government has a duty to the citizens who are the ones with power and authority and so the government should be responsible to the citizens and not to CCM.
he wanted CCM to keenly read the Chadema constitution, the third article about the power of the people and that us why the Chadema executive committee projected that the year 2013 is to push the government to be accountable to the citizens through the power of the people and not in any other way.
"the act of CCM announcing that the year 2013 is a working year means they previously had been sitting idle instead of being accountable to the citizens since they took power," said Mister Mnyika.

"it is not easy for me to disclose the secret of the life I live with my husband, it is our agreement.
basically our marriage is stable, they will wait for long and they will be tired themselves," said Aunt.

'students remind parents to wash'
it's written by Theddy Challe, Babati
published: 18th October 2016
the students of primary and secondary schools in Magugu village, in Babati District, Manyara region, have been advised to remind their parents to use clean water when washing their face due to their parents lacking that knowledge.
that was said by the former Governor of the International Lion Club (Lion International), East and Central Africa, Sakishi Sharima from Arusha.
the club volunteered to provide free eye testing services during the delivery of the service in the Magugu village in the district.
doctors of Saint Elizabeth Thomas Hospital, 'Father Babu', in collaboration with doctors from Haydom Hospital in Mbulu District, Manyara Province, have joined in providing eye surgery services and giving of eye glasses for two days 15th and 16th October for those with eye problems.
the sick that came out on the first day were 250 whereby among them 14 underwent eye surgery, but the second day they received approximately 600 patients, a situation that forced them to send others back home and they remained with 300 patients, while 36 underwent operation and gave more than 400 eye glasses for those who needed them.
the response of the residents of Magugu town, together with the neighboring villages, has seemed overwhelming as a result of the number of dependents on doctors treating 250 per day to increase and forced them to add a day for doing surgery for patients who still needed it. therefore, they have been told to go back home until they are called to go to hospital, and then they will return again.
the member of parliament for Babati rural, Jito Soni, explained that the need for eye disease treatment is high, they have been unable to afford the cost of treatment due to lack of funds.
he said in that under normal circumstances a patient pays as from 80,000 to 100,000 shillings for treatment and eye glasses sold to them for between 15,000 to 45,000 shillings, a situation that makes many to continue remaining at home without getting eye treatment.
the District Commissioner for Bahati, Raymond Mushi visited the area where the treatment was done and praised that club for their contribution and requested them to help them get a modern laboratory as a result of the hospital is the best in eye services in the Northern Region.
also, that member of parliament has requested various stakeholders to come out so as to improve various services of that center, which has a challenge of having a small ultrasound machine room and lack of a modern laboratory and also doesn't have a perimeter wall hence causing people to enter the center carelessly.

Rashid Mkwinda
the students of the University of Mzumbe of Mbeya today during the day joined with Tanzanians to celebrate the great day of reunion to provide relief to the community that takes care of orphans in the center of 'Malezi ya Huruma' that is in Simike, Mbeya city.
the aid of clothes, food, soap and cooking fat together with cash worth 3 million shillings that is from the contribution from the staff of that university together with the lecturers and students and some friends whose aim is to connect with the orphaned children in maintaining unity, brotherhood and solidarity together with the children that live in dangerous environment.
while speaking about that aid, the Head of that university, Professor Ernest Kihanga, said that they got that idea and saw the importance to involve that importance to the nation of Tanzania by engaging the community of people that lives in dangerous environment and to see the importance of visiting children that are being taken care in that center to provide what they have.
Professor Kihanga said that day has been very important to Tanzanians due to its history of fulfilling the 50 years of the union whereby there was a lot challenges and there was different problems socially and because of cooperating with orphaned children it will built a history which will have a big memory to these children because of the union of our countries.
"this will remain in the heads of these children, they will remember this important day of today which went together with the aid the we provided to them," he said.
and the Assistant lecturer of that University, John Stephen said that the teachers together with the students of that university sat together and saw the importance of cooperating with residents that live in dangerous environment so as to celebrate together with them on that day.
"we are part of the community, we are joining with these children so that they can see we are part of the community that is happy without caring about our difference in life within one group or the other," said Stephen who is also an independent lawyer.
on her side, Neema Mwalyagile who is also the Assistant Lecturer of that University said that the people of the same sex with different life they have a chance to know the history of the coalition between Tanganyika and Zanzibar and by using this important day so that those children will remain with that memory for many years.

while speaking at that time, as she received that aid, the Care provider of that center of Huruma of Simike that has a total of 120 Children, Anna Kasile said that she has received the aid at the appropriate time because there were some students of Sumbawanga Secondary school that are being taken care of that center and were sent away because they lacked school fees.
she said that she deals with a lot of challenges of operating that center and even though the society especially the students of the universities that are in Mbeya city have been coming out time to time to help in one way or another by providing assistance of status and property.

she said that they have a small baby in that center of four months who was found, thrown away and the eldest is a student who is in the university whereby some of them passed through this center are civil servants in the government.
our stone superstructure, base of wood and clay!
May 31, 2012
last week I tried to justify an argument by referring to the statement of the famous German philosopher Karl Marx, who once said that you cannot change the system of authority (superstructure) if the environment of the community base, including the economy (economic base), have not been ready.
I said the system of governance in any society is the fruit of the fantasy and practice of the community.
when Americans elected President Barrack Obama last year, they were not gambling.
they knew that apart from Obama being the first black citizen to lead the world's largest nation, far from the fact that he seemed to have ideas comparable to the Socialists Manifesto, but also, apart from Obama having a sense of humor, they still elected him to be president because they knew they already had the superstructure they had set up and could not be played by anyone including the president.
it is protected, together with other issues by the Constitution, law, free will, the economy, technology, democratic tradition and the level of knowledge of citizens of the country.
so maybe Tanzania let us not expect that because we have democracy of many parties as the United States, and that we are doing elections like the United States, and that we say our constitution protects many human rights and freedoms as set forth in the United Nations Declaration, that we have also developed democratically.
first of all, we have the greatest challenge as a society to achieve the democratic level we see in the West.
and the issue here is not just having democracy simply because of imitation, but from the scientific and historical fact that there are some basic human traits pursued in their lives, helps them to relieve them from chronic problems that threaten their presence.
various researchers differ in the way they look at Africa before colonialism.
there are a number of researchers who have shown that Africa was a dark continent and administrative systems that existed before were inferior.
there are real examples of dictatorial administrations that have been brutal and irrespective of human rights.
in fact, there are communities that the day the king died was to be buried together with four living crews, one in each corner of the grave.
but this violent example of African rulers those days does not help us to justify the issue of democracy because history does not leave whites safe.
for a long time in Europe there were also rulers cruel even more than cruelty.
and their other cruelty has not been put in the record because every time historians try to write the pen refuses to produce ink, and the keys of printing machines refuse to come up!
but there are also researchers who have tried to show that it is not true to say that, all African communities were governed by dictatorially by cruel leaders like Idd Amini of Uganda, king Bokassa of Central Africa and others who looked like them.
that there were African communities that had good procedures for listening to the views of the governed.
there are communities where the king or the speaker had his council of consultants which he was obliged to listen to.
and in those societies where the king or chief failed to meet or respect the basis for his power, he could then be removed through a process that guided that community.
one political science lecturer in the country has told me that before colonialism there were African societies that had certain democratic value and attitudes (democratic values and attitudes).
he said the difference was that those communities did not have democratic institutions with divisive responsibilities as we know in today's democratic systems, the government (the president and his team), the parliament and the courts.
that in those communities only one institution (the king and his council) did all the work of law formulation, passing judgment, administration, and law implementation.
in other words, in simple language, there was no other institution or agency to question the decisions of the King and his council.
the logic of this column today is to simplicity in light language the challenges that we Tanzanians, and Africans in general, have to face scientifically if we really have the true desire to succeed in bringing about our own development.
I started this column by talking about superstructure.
this is an English word and may have many meanings in different contexts.
one English dictionary defines superstructure as: "structure above foundations."
or "part of ship above deck."
that is part of the building on the base or top of the ship.
another English dictionary The Oxford Learner's English Dictionary defines the word as something built on something (my translation), for example the upper part of the ship or part of the building that is based on the base.
the second definition of superstructure states and I will write it in English first: "the systems and beliefs in the society that we have developed from more simple ones".
then it is illustrated: "the relationship between the economic base of society and the political superstructure of power".
and this is what Karl Marx was referring to when he said, it is a socio-economic basis that determines the type of administrative system that will exist in the relevant community.
maybe we look back to the superstructure concept and the examples we saw above starting with the model of a ship.
there is a Swahili proverb that says, "if you see them float, they have been created."
likewise, there are people who have tried to show wonder, at how it is that if a coin is dropped into the sea it immediately sinks, while a big ship and heavy cannot sink.
it should be noted that the original ships were made of trees.
the idea of big ships was due to the understanding and experience of the storks of the trees that human beings had at that time.
a tree log was dug in the middle to enable people to sit there and travel by floating on the water.
but as the need, knowledge, skill and dread grew in man, is when he made the best ship.
over the past 1,000 years there were whites who came to be known as Vikings.
they were only pirates who were traveling from one area to another doing mischief, including stealing, raping, fighting, but also doing business and demonstrating their skills in what they are good at.
but the history of Vikings has been more favorable to them (as once recognized by Winston Churchill) by remembering them more not for their rape, rather in their skill to make big ships, stable and those that had been adorned very well.
although they were wooden, those ships could travel long distances in the sea and withstand strong waves, unlike other transport equipment at the time.
the superstructure of Vikings' ships was wooden as it was at the bottom of the ship (the deck) which stretched into the sea.
as the years passed, ships were further improved.
over the years, due to scientific and technological advances, humans began to make ships using iron.
and I will apologize for the truth and forgive me if my thoughts will contradict the reality of what I am discussing.
the superstructure of ships began to be iron and stable immediately after the base of the ship was iron and more stable.
ships like the Titanic were really made big after knowledge, skill, and experience that a human being had collected from other ships to enable him to make it.
and when they built the Titanic they called it "Unsinkable."
which is not immersible.
they knew that with the presence of many floors in the ship and the heavy weight in the superstructure that was iron, the base of the ship had the balance to make it safe.
that base (base) was strong enough to handle the superstructure of the ship itself.
and even the sinking of the Titanic was caused by an accident of hitting an iceberg.
today, the United States has built a ship bigger than the Titanic.
it has playgrounds, conference halls, comfort places, et cetera.
its superstructure has more floors than the Titanic but its base still has the ability to sustain it.
the constitution gives a citizen the freedom of speaking and converging.
if there is anything the Kenyan citizens are supposed to be proud of is the constitution that was passed in 2010.
the constitution is the one that protects the rights of every Kenyan, children or adults without discrimination.
because of the constitution, everyone gets protection.
it's in the constitution every citizen has been given the freedom to speak, converge, protest and cooperate with others.
under the constitution, there is no one allowed to discriminate or treat people as slaves.
everyone has been given so many rights.
the time the constitution says the rights of a person should be revoked, is when he becomes a threat to the national security or a danger to the security of people themselves.
I was surprised when a case was brought to court to halt the meeting for the Cord coalition that took place two days ago.
I would like to educate the Jubilee leaders that there's freedom of converging in the constitution and there's no person who can ever prevent people from meeting and consulting each other.
I congratulate the high court for clarifying the elements and explaining to the leaders with dictatorial legacy that they have no chance.
Alfred Nyandieka, Nairobi.
let's educate girls, every time I look at women's efforts in ensuring girls get education especially among the pastoralist communities, I get surprised as to why they shouldn't be acknowledged and rewarded.
it is clear that these are women who know the sweetness of education and have eaten its fruits.
I say that women's efforts are supposed to be congratulated and they should be invited and awarded even medals during state functions for making a contribution towards the girl child's education.
I call upon the Turkana, Mandera and Wajir communities to arise from their deep sleep and educate girls.
our opinion maker, Nairobi.
rot has grown until: rot has fixed its roots into our communities in Kenya.
even though the development is good and the stability in technology is something commendable, many things have gone amiss.
the current generations have embraced technology genuinely and have tried to immerse themselves into recognizing its usefulness.
and it is now frustrating how many ladies are increasingly bundling their photos publicly on the internet for the sake of gaining fame with ease.
an increase in shameful photos portraying private parts in social media is clear proof that, morality among the youths has deteriorated.
however, it is not only the youths who are being blamed.
I would like to point an accusatory finger to the press for making a major contribution in losing direction on good morals.
Martin Muchina, Multimedia University.
security has deteriorated: security in Molo town has deteriorated following the killings especially the shocking recent ones.
the deaths of three girls killed and their bodies dumped in the forests are the ones that annoyed the area residents most.
I request the county government of Nakuru to promote security so that the fear that is causing many to be anxious.
the frequent criminal incidents happening should not continue because the governor was a security officer.
Rotich K Benjamin, Masinde University.
Raila should stop inciting before the general election, the former Prime Minister Raila Odinga said that he will accept the outcome of the results.
now why can't he believe that he was defeated and respect the citizens' decision? instead of putting up strategies for the next election, he is engaging himself with incitement against the government.
we all remember his sentiments, "seventh, July on the Saba Saba day.
if they do not come to talk to us, there won't be work the whole of Kenya."
which development loving leader incites citizens against working because the government has refused to heed to his personal call? Salim Dawood Salim, Maasai Mara University.
citizens should assist the police, the 10,000 security officers who will be employed are urged to know their major role is protecting the citizens and their properties.
without doubt, everyone knows that without police officers among the society, crime would have fixed its roots.
it is clear that citizens manage to get sleep because police officers are on patrol and if one tries to hold onto someone's property, he is usually taken to the police station and charged.
if we will need to be protected as required, then citizens will have to support the police efforts of destroying crime.
I urge citizens to heed to the advice that says, win yourself to win, so that we can get better services.
Doris Kambua, Machakos.

he said the period of research for normal way of maize has been complete and six new type A of maize has been found, and right now by following instructions for living things safety, will start research of maize through a way of engineering.
policy and regulations are there, we will do research of GMO and the result of research will give out the direction of our plan for farming," said Doctor Turuka.
in other process, Doctor Turuka want the maize seed researcher in the country, to make sure those good seed they do research with, are getting to farmers earlier.
"the government is satisfy with this project of WEMA because it helps the farmer to get good seeds which can withstand dryness and cannot be destroyed by sickness," said Doctor Turuka.
he said by using good seed which come out through that research, a farmer can get 8.5 tones of maize in one hectare and he emphasize that, if those seeds will not reach to a farmer earlier, that project will not be helping the government.
Doctor Turuka said the government is looking closely into the rules and regulations for giving researchers a wide field without polluting the environment and endangering the citizens' lives in the process of carrying out their research.
the executive director of the National Science and Technology Commission (COSTECH), Doctor Hassan Mashinda said the seed research gives an opportunity to farmers to get better seeds and that the research that was done in partnership with researchers from various countries has shown great success.
the coordinator of WEMA project, Doctor Alois Kullaya said the project started in the year 2008 and that they've been using current methods to get better seed.
he said Tanzania and other countries are already released 59 seeds whereby in the country there are only six seeds which are produced.
he added that South Africa have already legalized the use of GMO seeds.

40 students in secondary and primary schools in Lindi district in that province have become pregnant from January to September this year.
the head of Lindi district, Shaibu Ndemanga has said that when he was speaking with 'HabariLeo' in his office in this town.
he said that several steps have been taken against those responsible for the pregnancies, parents who failed to cooperate with the relevant authorities.
the steps including taking to court the involved, to investigate more on the problem through a committee that has been established.

his innovation is an answer to agriculture.
by Benardine Mutanu
technology has been his characteristic since the time he was an engineering student at the University of Nairobi until now.
the work of Antony Mwangi of coming up with and innovating by using modern technology has put him on the map of reputable designers in the country.
just recently, it will be possible to roast meat by using remote light (remote) through his amazing inauguration.
Mister Mwangi who is 26 years old, graduated from the University of Nairobi (UoN) with an engineering degree last year and before graduating already he had got enough fame.
he was among the youth who had attended the global innovation forum (GES) last year.
he was chosen to be among the youth who attended that meeting because of his amazing innovation.
when he was first mentioned by the media in the year 2014, Mister Mwangi had designed six major technological projects.
he started by trying phone technology (GSM) and while a second-year student at that university, he had created a system that enables a user to switch off or switch on electrical equipment anywhere in the world.
that system also can be used to switch on alarms, for example at home, in the car or protected areas if those areas will be entered into, he explained during an interview recently.
by using that system, he was able to create a way of sprinkling water on plants without a farmer's presence, a project he did for a company known as Sunculture.
he didn't stop there, that old UoN student right now is created a system of preparing roast meat remotely.
he provides training to students of secondary schools concerning how to make electronic items like machines that work instead of humans (robot).
he attended the Embu education day where he provided training yesterday after receiving more invitations, that he has shown his skill in various areas including the University of Nairobi, Kenya Power Company, and national agricultural shows.
"in Kenya, there is no such training for students.
but we have started to provide that training in order to strengthen technological ability in the country.
we want to train students so that they can have the ability to make items that can help the community in a creative way," he explained during the interview.
students are given real electronics training and how to make those items, "I remember former education minister Professor Kaimenyi praised that kind of training when I attended the Embu shows," explained Mister Mwangi.
according to him, students should be taught electronics and computer programs when they are still young so that they grow knowing how to make items.
"if that will happen, we will have the technological ability and there will be no need to import items from outside countries," he explained.
already, he has provided training to Lenana secondary school students, Nairobi and he continues to provide training to students of Moi forces academy secondary education.
he started the company, K-Technics that makes electronic prototypes, programs, and innovative items.
that company also has an online shop that provides components for making electronic items.
"usually we sell raw materials of accomplishing electronics projects and the skill of those projects to students, self-driving items and to make digital boards," explained Mister Mwangi.
although of young age, Mister Mwangi is an employer and usually, he provides casual work now and then.
he moved from Ngara, where he had offices earlier and opened his shop in the City of Nairobi.
he has been getting tenders to create and accomplish projects from different companies.
the GES meeting helped him much to get partners in major companies like Equity bank, the information, communication, and technology board, Lenana school and various managers at the county level.
"the Kenya power company has helped me much because they gave me a chance, to show my creativity in their tent any time there are national shows (ASK)".
he made a demonstration to that company concerning how to protect transformers, and pleased the management which decided to give him a chance that he would be doing shows in their tent.
to him, technological creativity is the only way of strengthening development in the country.
in the next two years, he intends to change the face of this nation technologically by providing training to more students and all who need to get scientific and electronics training.
slum dwellers enjoy good scores
Likii slum dwellers in Nanyuki, celebrated after two students from the town obtained 417 and 416 marks in the KCPE.
happy songs spread in the slum known for smelling alcohol residents praising Lucy Muthoni who scored 417 and Hamza Githae, who scored 416.
the students said it was due to hard work in the studies and neglected the environment they came from out that made them successful.
Muthoni was studying Saint Christopher's primary school and Githae was studying at Saint Moses's school in Nanyuki.
their parents were so excited that their children made the slum a great deal of pride and would not be despised by the city again.

Written by Khatib Suleiman, Zanzibar
published: 13 October 2016
Leaders of the East Africa Community Countries, have been required to prioritize implementation of policies that empower small-scale farmers and breeders, in order to make a step in development and poverty eradication.
this was said by a parliamentarian in the East African Community Parliament from Rwanda, Patrician Hajabakiga, when he was presenting a Committee report of that Parliament on development in the farming sector and tourism, at a sitting in East Africa Parliament which is going on at a Council of Representatives Chukwani, just outside the city of Unguja.
he said the time has come now to ensure farming and livestock sector are given first priorities in the countries of that community since there is enough land to strengthen agriculture and making it become a business.
he said efforts that should be done to be it is countries of the East African Community to create good policies that will enable farmers to make a big step in that sector.
however, he wanted the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania to implement Malabo's resolution of satisfying itself with enough agricultural harvest since there still are citizens who are facing the problem of poor meals, despite having a bigger space of fertile land.
in addition, East Africa Community countries have been urged to use the available opportunity to encourage businesspeople to invest in business and industrial farming.
he said farmers will add effort in producing various products including fruits if there will be industries receiving products from agricultural produce.
initially, a bill of controlling plastic products that endangers environmental pollution was presented and read for the first time by the former Minister of environment from Rwanda, parliamentarian Patricia Hajabakiga.

the hit maker of the new single hold my hand of D-Knob today has amplified, the reasons of tying a knot quietly in year 2009 while the total of those people who attended together with the couple which was not more than 10 people from the church up to where they were going from the church.
"I wanted to do it with my partner, I told him we have been lovers but now it is needful for us to be in marriage, he said let us go we led each other to the church, the priest said you cannot marry each other, you do you know what marriage is?"
there is a step
it is not something that we wanted to do like a lot of people so that you start contribution because all my close friends are broke, I would not want to tie a knot and then at the end of the day to be mad at each other that this one did not contribute or that one contributed, the second one I wanted to do it so that I can continue with my life the way someone decides to celebrate his birthday.

DC has selected 6 through the entertainment law.
written by Sophia Mwambe.
printed 19 November 2016.
head of the Kinondoni district, Ally Hapi, has formed a committee of six people to go through the law concerned with entertainment issues as well as collecting views from shareholders, vendors, bars and hotels and doing research on how music sound is scheduled.
that committee will carry that research so that this business can be archived without violating the laws of the country and without being tortured or tortured by anyone else.
Hapi formed the committee at his discussion session with homeowners, bar and hotels that took place in that region.
he said that that committee will have to have a writing that will advise on ways of archiving that business, including authenticity of the laws of running the entertainment sessions.
he added that, homeowners, hotel and bar are supposed to make sure that they run their sessions on legal foundations, and the principle to avoid the noise of a musical nature in those regions.
Kinondoni Municipality Director, Aron Kagurumjui, wanted those owners to make sure the focus is on the directions they were given to reduce unnecessary relationships in running the entertainment session.
Diamond Platinum bashes the National Arts Council -BASATA
Diamond Platnumz has castigated the National Arts Council BASATA for rolling back Tanzanian music by not permitting the introduction of other music awards in the country, aside from Kilimanjaro Music Awards. while speaking at the XXL program on Clouds FM today, Diamond said that this action makes him feel that there is a hidden agenda in that council.
"why do we have only one award in Tanzania, it's something that saddens me very much because if you look at even other small countries, we are musically superior but they have more than one award," Diamond questioned.
"I do not know what is going on in BASATA".
he said if there could be a variety of music awards in the country, there would be positive challenge to the organizers of those awards rather than as it is now whereby KTMA has no rival.
"if there are various awards they will learn from others but if there is only one thing every day, then it's just done".
on the other hand, Diamond said after the Kili nominations were out, he could not comment on anything since he saw that he had been put in categories that he did not deserve.
"if you look keenly if I was not in any category at all how then can I be the best male artist, under what criteria?" he questioned.
"now you're telling me that I do not have the characteristics of a member of parliament, councilor, minister, do not have those characteristics and then you make me compete for the presidency now, how will I win then if we can't at the beginning?"
"I saw, you know what, I'd better be keep quiet, I did not want to speak because they're not late to interpret you differently, that is why I was not there in those days, to be completely honest".
the lost opportunity: if I was the president I would have spoken Swahili the tour of Obama
the Swahili language of the Swahili people is like a bastard on the coast of the Swahili people, poor and its mother dead at its birth, it was raised by its step father Mwalimu Nyerere who died from blood cancer.
Swahili was left alone while young but its health is good, it continues to grow,
congratulations to its step father who truly loves Swahili though he killed his wife during his birth.
Swahili is an orphan who now has to grow on the streets again and be called a street child because he will never step again to the state house or international events, may be if Chissano gets back into power in that neighboring country, Mozambique.
congratulations to Chissano for remembering Swahili although you passed Tanzania
just to ask for assistance of liberating your country, being brave you did not forget the contribution of Swahili to achieve the issues of Mozambique.
why have we lost all chances to grow Swahili, the council of Swahili just eats the finances of Tanzanians or what work does it do?
it did not advise the president to use the opportunity of the coming of Obama to announce Swahili or was the president stubborn?
the president is like an institution or this institution is the answer of being tricky to Makinda ANNE?
congratulations Kenya Airways for announcing Swahili to the world.
why should the president be frustrated to a point of using English while Swahili is there?
even if the president is very good in English, there is no opportunity of announcing our nationally and Swahili?
thus the Japanese, Chinese, Russians and Arabians when they speak their languages it is like they don't know English completely or they want to Mark correctly because of who they are, to be identified in the world that they are free nationalities and their languages are free for their own use.
Swahili lacks that attraction at home and outside the country.
sorry all these has an end or the day you die or the day you will be remembered, humiliation is the turban of crust.
truly, Tanzanians you have really disappointed us again, one opportunity lost in the hands and the mouths of state house, it is very dangerous because it might never happen again for decades, the presidential advisors, state house what are you doing? what are you advising?
why is it like you are stopping the president?
what did he do to you that you are now paying for all that evil?
did he not trust you to help him with the job?
who will speak Swahili if it is not the president and the state house of Dar?
what is wrong with Swahili that it is rejected in its home?
I pray the government will think again and to create strategies so that the president and state house will speak Swahili in all the activities including the international ones, there is a day that shame will be very big, I am repeating whatever we are seeing is just a smell, there is a day we will the carcass itself.
Swahili, Swahili, I love you my national language.
I request to submit.

six things to do when you are looking for a job.
to look for a job is to enter into the labor market which basically is a field of connecting people who have great needs of two types.
one side, there are people who are 'products' of skills and talents, but they have a need of getting an income by using their skills and the knowledge that they have.
they are called job seekers.
on the second side, they are people who are in need of that knowledge so that it can help them to increase success in the services they provide by using the resources and money to pay for that skill.
they are called employers.
these both sides need each other and depend on each other because the need of one side is the answer to the second side.
so that you can be employed, you are forced to satisfy your employer that you have skills and the capability of using the knowledge that you have in increasing success of the services he provides.
due to the reality that employees vary by skill and that capability and because the capability of various employers is different, and because it's impossible for every knowledgeable person to meet the needs of the employer, this is where the idea of competition in the labor market comes out.
this is to say, so as to compete well in the labor market it's the responsibility of the person who is looking for work to prepare himself as required with the knowledge and skill.
let's us look for six important things to do when you are entering into the labor market to increase the possibility of employment.
build your identity
your identity is like advertising the products that you have in the market.
if you are looking for a job, your products are the skills that you have, knowledge and the thoughts that identifies you to others.
it is very important to look for an environment to advertise your products.
in today's world, communication has been made easy.
get onto the internet, create your website by engaging in hard work and the areas you are popular.
there are social sites like Facebook, Twitter, blogs, LinkedIn and all of them are very free.
you don't pay anything more than being joined with the internet network.
instead of using those networks to chat idly and to follow news that is not helpful, use it to show your the contribution you have in the community.
through what you are writing, people will see you and it will help to increase your competition in the labor market.
understand where information on employment is found.
you are forced to follow up closely different sources of news to get information on employment.
there are special websites that are prepared for people and private institutions for the purpose of sharing news of jobs.
and the government, for example, it has a special page called http://portal.ajira.go.tz/ it helps you to get information on job positions in the government whenever they are available.
as well, the Ministry of Labor and Employment has a special unit called employment agency (Taesa) which together with other responsibilities, it provides advisory services and statistics on employment issues to the employers and job seekers, to spread information on the labor market to different stakeholders together with connecting job seekers and employers inside and outside the country.
let them follow up through their page http://www.taesa.go.tz/jobs.
create a network
most of the times, we expect that the job posts to be announced.
but some other times, jobs are many especially in private sectors but they are not announced openly.
the reason is that most of the employers have a character of looking for people who are trusted and some other times to be directed to people who can be understood.
it is because of this, that it is important to create a network of people that are trusted who can help you to get information on employment once they are available.
participate in conferences, seminars and workshops which together with enhancing skills, it will connect with different people who can be of help to you in the journey of looking for employment.
volunteer to work without payment.
the tradition of volunteering is not practiced in our community.
the expectations of most graduates after completing colleges is to wait for employment that has a pay and they are not ready to do 'work that has no pay'.
if you have looked for a job for a certain period of time and you are not successful, maybe the challenge is lack of experience that is needed by the employers.
so as to confront this challenge, use that time that you are passing through by making yourself experienced without official employment.
volunteer to work without payment.
look for institutions that provide services that match with your skills.
show the interest of finding experience.
doing that will help you to improve your information on experience and therefore increase the chances of employment.
prepare your documents well.
the quality of your personal information puts you in a big position to convince the employer to accept you.
use the period that you are passing through to keep well your personal information (Curriculum vitae) they will help you to improve your job application that you will send later.
it is advised that you go through your information time to time in order to make them distinguish you well, who are you, what knowledge do you have, what education and experience.
as well, it is important to prepare job application letters for each job that you apply.
normally, application letters changes time to time in regards to the specific requirements of the job advertisement that is being requested.
it is better to arrange all these document early so that it will be easy to rectify so that they satisfy the requirements of the job being requested for.
reduce expectations, don't lose hope
having an expectation of getting a better job that is respectable is a good thing.
dream is important.
but, other times, you can start with anything small that is found to enable you to get what you are aiming at.
in a very competitive environment of employment, it is not wise to choose jobs.
in addition, looking for employment is a process that can make you to get tired.
other times, you can get answers that brings despair.
there is no reason for you to despair.
give heart being in life, there is nothing good without a cost.
when you are hopeful, you can follow up on your issues keenly and more seriously.
follow the work and employment magazine in the Mwananchi newspaper every Friday for topics like these.

the government wants the business people at Dagaa border to improve the environment of their businesses
Rashid Mkwinda
the government wants the business people of meat and fish products in the border to improve the environment of their businesses so that it can be attractive to internal and neighboring countries buyers.
while speaking with the business people at the Dagaa border of Tanzania and Zambia in a small city of Tunduma, the Minister of Livestock and Fishery, Doctor Titus Kamani, said in order for these business people to benefit more they should improve the environment of their businesses.
he said, the buyers from different areas of the neighboring countries are checking more on the quality of the environment that is being operated in these businesses and the fish products needs hygiene because of the environment and the kind of business itself.
"you know fish and seafood needs great care and a clean environment, when people are face to face with an environment that is not clean, they are disgusted and discouraged to buy your products" said Doctor Kamani.
on his side, the head of the district of Momba, Abihudi Saideya, said that the residents of Momba district get fish through Lake Rukwa which is on the side of the valley of that district.
he said, however, that for a period of six months the lake was closed because of the damage to the environment which was done by the citizens and thus caused the lake to dry up and the production of fish was poor.
"we closed Lake Rukwa with the cooperation of the district who are the main users of this lake, we opened it after 6 months but still the production is low" said Saideya.
and the officer of fisheries for Momba district, Ali Libenanga, said that for the six month period after the opening of that lake, a total of 108 million has been collected from the taxes of fisheries and even though the fish that are being produced in that lake are stagnate and not growing at right level.
Doctor Kamani did his tour by visiting the business people of Dagaa who are on the border of Tunduma to check the environment of those businesses that are in the borders areas whereby he also met with Executive Councils of the city of Tunduma.
Sitta warned.
March 06th, 2014.
the recommendations by the parliamentarians of the Revolutionary Party who are also delegates of the Constitutional Assembly that the speaker of the ninth parliament, Samuel Sitta vies for the chairmanship of the Constitutional Assembly have erupted a debate among some of the delegates of that vessel, with many supporting delegate Hasimu Rungwe warning Sitta not to propagate what he called the Revolutionary Party's curse.
Rungwe who entered the Constitutional Assembly through the group of nominees by President Jakaya Kikwete has expressed his worry about Sitta's recommendation as the chairperson of the special Constitutional Assembly because..."
he has the Revolutionary Party's curse of forgetting other communal groups in the country and fighting for their own side alone.
however, Rungwe's worry who has not openly declared whether he will vie for that position or not just after the passing of the laws of that parliament, is being opposed by the other delegates who spoke to this newspaper, believing Sitta is their good choice when the election period comes because his record in overseeing parliamentary bills involving opposing groups is known.
those delegates have explained their hopes or worries on the recommendation of Sitta, while several days are gone and big names are being mentioned to be able to vie for the chairmanship of the Constitutional Assembly, just after the official passing of the laws of that parliament.
apart from Sitta, the other names that were being mentioned were together with Asha Rose Migiro, Mathias Chikawe, Paul Kimiti and Andrew Chenge, all being Revolutionary Party's members and party's parliamentarians, apart from Kimiti alone who comes from the group of nominees by President Kikwete.
speaking to Good Citizen in Dodoma city on Tuesday this week, the Kinondo parliamentarian, Idd Azzan said he believes that history is giving Sitta a good chance to democratically lead the assembly.
"if you remember how he coordinated the ninth parliament, you can't be doubtful of Sitta's ability in this tough parliament," said Azzan whose opinions are similar to the other delegates, when you remove the CCM ones who approved him on one voice at a private sitting last Sunday in Dodoma city.
however, on the side of the nominated parliamentarian Ezekiel Oluoch, he said that the existence of strict rules of leading the special Constitutional Assembly will give anyone elected as the chairperson the ability to coordinate well the parliament's sessions and not his history.
it is the rules that will enable whoever will be chairman to work well.
it is a must for whoever will be there to focus on the laws, and it is the reason we are fighting to ensure better rules are passed.
people are supposed to understand that this is not an ordinary parliament.
it is not political and neither does it require a person with political thoughts or intentions.
"the foundation of this parliament is mediation more than the number of delegates supporting a certain bill," said the delegate who is a leader of the Tanzania Teachers' Union (TTU).
Oluoch also cast doubt on the temporary chairperson of the Constitutional Assembly, Pandu Ameir Kificho, saying during this time leading the parliament, he has shown leaning more towards the political side and his fellow politicians.
he said Kificho has been giving a huge opportunity to people known to him leaving out the delegates not known, but who have strong arguments without a chance to air them.
while speaking about Sitta, Hashimu Rungwe said Sitta for now seems to lean towards his party and he is for his interests.
a person changes.
Sitta of the ninth parliament can't be the Sitta of the special Constitutional Assembly.
this one has the CCM's curse of forgetting the other societal groups and fights for their side alone.
we need a chairperson who doesn't take sides because for now this temporary one (Kificho) has a side he's standing for.
"you'll find that an argument has ended well but then he turns it around to erupt a new argument," said Rungwe.
even though he didn't said he will vie for the position, Rungwe said he believes after the passing of the law, an opportunity will be given to those who want to vie for the position to collect a form, and that is where those who will fight it out with Sitta will be known from other groups.
in another move, yesterday, Thursday, the situation inside the special parliament hall suddenly turned when all the female delegates united and loudly demanded for the review of the law that directs on how to elect the chairperson and the vice chairperson of that parliament.
according to the eighth section of the draft of the special parliament laws, those leaders of the special constitution will be elected according to the 23 (4) section of the law of the constitutional change of last year.
firefighters in Kagera warn the drivers in Bukoba.
the firefighting and rescue squad from Kagera Region has warned drivers who do not take precautions against fire disasters to endanger their lives and the machines they are operating.
that warning was given while it is was only few days after oil tankers exploded and caused deaths in Benako area Kasulo ward, Ngara district with what is related with not taking caution during offloading of oil in the tanker which was stuck in mud.
Information and Public Education Officer from that squad, Sergeant Kabuka Odey said many fire disasters are caused by laziness and negligence.
"other time when we stand them to educate, they complain they have a long journey, it is true that death of fire which explode in Benako they did not follow instructions of having caution during the time of serving oil," said Odeny.
last year more than five cars was sprout and destroyed in Nykahula place Biharamuko district.
in Africa, it is taboo to rejoice about death
it is against customs and traditions of many African communities to humiliate and to despise the dead.
it is normal for a community to mourn even a thug ambushed and killed while committing crime.
that state is what carry out crime.
that condition is what differentiates us from other communities elsewhere in the world.
we are heading to ethical perversion when we turn a family tragedy and make it a political platform where we mutilate each other and throw 'mud' at each other.
for example, what kind of anger makes a person appear to celebrate the death of a fellow human being because of political differences?
since the son of the former prime minister Raila Odinga died on Sunday morning, Kenyans of different walks have shown up to mourn that young man whose associates mentions him as kind and loving.
but the most annoying thing is that the mourning has taken a tribal and political course in that there are some who appear to celebrate while saying it is a worthy punishment to the family of Mister Odinga which has been a thorn politically to his opponents.
it is clear that such a family which has been involved with opposition politics for a long time and to have tough stands might have so many political enemies.
but there are boundaries where politics is separated from normal life.
that is saying, in other words, politics is not a matter of life and death.
Mister Odinga and his family are mourning their child with a human heart, what we urge those bubbling out insults on the internet are supposed to stop that habit.
that is not the image of our Kenyanism ever.
like we once said in these platforms, maybe tribalism will take us into the pit of destruction as a country if we won't take caution.
it is hard to understand whatever is pushing a person to hate another on the basis, that they come from different communities to a level that they seem to be happy at the death of one of them.
and while investigations associated with the death of the late Fidel Odinga continues, we urge everyone to give investigators and pathologists time to determine what killed that uprising businessman.
leaders in the council of Mwanza, Ilemela exchange muscles

while the Mwanza city council and Ilemela municipal were in the tug-of-war of who has the right to own the construction project of the modern Mwanza market (Mwanza Commercial Complex), which begun before the councils were divided, right now the conflict is said to have been influenced more by personal interest than the public interest.
the project of building that source of livelihood is run in partnership between the city council before the city was divided on one side and the pension funds for civil servants (LAPF).
the project is being put up in Ghana region in Nyamanoro division within the borders of Ilemela municipal.
since the Mwanza city municipal was divided to give birth to the city council and the Ilemela municipal council, there has been tug-of-war that involves development projects, including Mwaloni Kirumba international market and building of the new town Muhonze, all in the borders of Ilemela municipal council, for Mwanza city council wanting to own and govern it.
the conflict on who is supposed to own the Mwanza Commercial Complex came up again at the end of last week in the meeting of the advisory committee of Mwanza province (RCC), which among other things, a report about that project was supposed to be given.
moreover, a representative of the director of Mwanza city council, Francis Mkabenga, when he wanted to read the report in that meeting he met opposition from the mayor of Ilemela municipal council, Henry Matata, who gave information to the head of province, Evarist Ndikillo, who was the chairman of that meeting saying that Mwanza city council is not allowed to head that project because it does not have legal rights.
"honorable chairman, these ones (Mwanza city council) are not allowed to give this information because they don't have jurisdiction to head that project and you are not supposed to support breaking of the law, therefore I request that the information should not be given... if they want us to cooperate they should write a letter to us requesting us to partner in the project or we don't read the information,"
moreover, the head of province, Ndikillo explained that together with the fact that those councils have been divided, but still construction projects are read and to recognize city councils.
moreover, he said the money for Ilemela municipal council from the account goes through the city, therefore they should wait until July this year when they will start being independent on everything, and then things shall be put in order.
Ndikillo's point made mayor Matata stand again and insist that the law of local governments of the year 1982 is clear about that issue, therefore Mwanza city council has no authority to keep managing that project.
after mayor Matata gave that point, Nyamangana's representative, Hezekiah Wenje also stood to counter him with explanations that them as the city council have had good agreements with Ilemela, and more so they have been working as brothers and therefore there is no point of distrusting each other.
"we have been working as brothers, even when our fellows peers isolated themselves, we helped them by all means to build their municipal including even giving the cooking pots to start life with, so where does this mistrust come from?" questioned Wenje.
however, Ilemela member of parliament Highness Kiwia, disputed his fellow member of parliament saying that Mwanza city council have not been honest in everything they agree on giving examples of agreements they reached about projects with doubts to be made a union committee before implementation but all those projects, including the the market and the disagreement that came up in the attempt to move Mwaloni market to Kirumba in the city council when it was in the borders of Ilemela municipal council.
"brother chairman, until now Ilemela municipal council does not know what is going on in this project.
we don't even know the construction contract.
how can you say the contribution of the council in this project is land that came from Ilemela, our peers dominate everything... there is great betrayal from the city council," said Kiwia.
on his side, Buchosa member of parliament who is also the deputy minister for transport, Charles Tizeba, advised that the report be read with an aim of just giving information so that other members of parliament from other councils get an opportunity to know what is going on about that project, but he requested that the report should not be discussed until when the two sides meet to solve that dispute.
both sides agreed with that opinion, and the report was read without discussion.

helping a child to learn, to master a language -2.
past articles suggested four ways to help a young child know how to speak.
likewise, we have seen the main steps that a child passes through in learning a language.
in this article, we look at a child who knows how to speak and we look at several suggestions to help him become a skillful language user in his daily communication.
the environment should induce language.
it is important to create an environment that gives the child the opportunity to develop his language skills.
the environment includes allowing him to play with his friends for some time.
playing is a good opportunity for a child to communicate with others about the principles of the concerned games, to discuss when they disagree and so forth, thus developing his ability to express himself.
similarly, as often as it allows, it is good to find a baby cartoon CD (for example, Ubongo Kids), songs and other lessons and you must allow the child to watch television programs containing content that can expand his understanding.
all of this, apart from expanding common sense, helps him develop his vocabulary and even learn many things he does not hear in conversations with other people at home.
when he starts learning to read, picture books that attract him to learn more have a big chance of helping him to understand various things that go with his age.
that is, it is best to ensure that home environment gives the child a chance to learn the language.
speak with him
friendly conversations with the child also motivate him to learn correct use of language.
talking to him gives him the opportunity to imitate and learn the words of kindness in life.
these words add a new vocabulary to the child that carry the broadest ideas that in normal circumstances, probably he might not hear from the children of his age.
when speaking to him, even so, it is important to make sure the language becomes easier, open and one on one.
a complex language not easy to understand easily does not help to learn.
ask him questions that make him think.
questions that need to be thoroughly analyzed help him develop his language skills.
instead of asking him questions that require yes and no answers, or those with short answers, ask him questions that require slightly longer explanations.
for example, such questions as 'why do you think so?'
makes him think more about what he could easily answer for either yes or no.
likewise, questions that ask him the way in which he did certain things, questions that make him think more than what he did, help him learn to use the words that he already knows in expressing himself much better.
give him a chance to tell you
similarly, giving him the opportunity to tell you the things he encounters helps him build his own ability to express himself.
it has been proven that children who get the opportunity to narrate their issues to others, get to a better space of knowing language more than those who don't get that opportunity.
when the child is obliged to explain his things in his words, he learns how to understand how to express his emotions by using the correct words and at the right time.
for example; you might ask him to talk about what he sees on television, games he played at noon, the good things he learned at school/church/madrasa, who made him enjoy his day and things like that.
narrating these things develops his ability to explain things.
in general, parental and child-orientation is the primary source of the child's language.
as you stay around him, in that way he gets help to develop his ability to express himself and become a skillful language user.

dd "all the time Ivan is in Kampala he hangs out with Doreen.

2009 if we make up our mind, we'll manage May 29, 2012
year 2008 is coming to an end in books of history.
it is a year that in whatever measures remain to be historic as a result of the various events that have left their marks in the lives and hearts of our citizens.
this ending year has been memorable for many things, both good and bad, of joy and of sorrow, of laughter and of crying!
it is a year that if we wanted to repeat it, we would find ourselves faced with the argument of choosing whether the good that happened outweighs the bad.
I give my condolences to our readers who like me this year, have lost people close to them, siblings, relatives and friends we have grown up with, and those who have lost their spouses and their children or their parents.
these are sorrows that are part of our lives as humans, but it is a grief that one cannot get used to or predict.
it is God himself who is our comfort and our fortress in times of tribulations.
to whom we submit and pray for mercy for all the lost souls, Amen.
I also congratulate with a hand of blessing all those who in their various capacities, stood to implement their roles in servicing their country.
there are thousands of public servants who with a doubt are finishing the year with a clear conscience before them and before the God of their faith, that they faithfully did that which their country mandated them to do.
the names of the majority of them are not mentioned in public and what they did are not welcomed in the council.
them that made the nation progress and reach where it is today.
are they that despite the hard economic times, despite the various wrangles and the challenges in their personal lives, wake up every morning thinking about service to their nation.
are they whose names are not mentioned during thanksgiving when the leaders are recognized and that when the books of history will be written, they may even not be mentioned.
these brothers of mine are the hidden strength that has been propelling the nation's agenda and grant us hope that we too can make it.
to these, we thank them for the service that has been worthy of praise in our nation for this past year, without you, without a doubt many things could not have been accomplished and this fight against corrupt people and corruption in the country would not have reached here.
we thank you.
together with them, all the same we have no option but to confess the sole goal of all who lead the nation and various departments at a time when corrupt individuals almost took over leadership by force with impunity.
we got to a point where we perceived some individuals in the country to be untouchable, cannot be questioned or criticized but there are those that despite their personal shortcomings and even the limitations of their positions, have tried to do all that is expected of them!
in a special way we must acknowledge the role of the Parliamentary Select Committee led by Doctor Harrison Mwakyembe and his colleagues and also Attorney General Johnson Mwanyika's team.
these two teams to a great extend give us a little sense of pride for public service.
we cannot say much without acknowledging the contribution of the various members of parliament who have stood firm in managing the affairs of the nation and demonstrated to us the differences existing among legislatures that we have.
we now know who is the real 'defender' of our country and who exactly is
'defender' of his embezzlement and of his friends!
this past year has drawn a distinction between people's representatives and the representatives of the parties!
today there are no conflicts between who is "ours" and who is "theirs."
we have come to the end of this year knowing well that if there is a sector of the nation that has faced enormous challenges is the police department and the department of National Security and the Prevention and Combating of Crime Bureau (PCCB).
these three organs in a special way are responsible for ensuring us as a nation continue to remain in a state of tranquility, peace and under the rule of the law.
these organs together with the department of the prosecutor are to a large extend responsible for ensuring our country remains as one, and a place where every Tanzanian feels safe.
for a long time we have been writing how these institutions have been failing us and made us question if they really have capacity to accomplish their duties.
it's true that we have experienced many challenges that we believe if these instruments could be doing their work accordingly in the past, we could not be here.
that was the main basis of our criticism especially on the security of the nation.
we believe that any place where such departments are weak, then corrupt leadership prevails.
we have witnessed in various areas in the world and now our place is an example.
together with our criticism, one issue that we have been recognizing is the special place of these instruments and as a result the prevailing environment, the sensitivity of their roles should be appreciated and their enormous contribution towards achieving today's fight against corruption recognized.
IGP said Mwema, National Security Director Rashid Othman, Doctor Edward Hosea of PCCB and State Attorney General Mwanyika have worked in a hostile environment with enormous challenges.
their departments have carried huge responsibilities of ensuring that corrupt individuals and their progeny do not prevail!
despite the fact that they themselves are faced with a number of questions that still need answers we have to acknowledge and accept their efforts that have shown fruit in the form of desire.
they still have a big responsibility to accomplish the fight against corruption, the murdering of albinos, robbery among others.
whatever the case, we have to acknowledge and accept their contribution this year.
we also acknowledge to a large extend the special contribution of the President of the Republic Jakaya Kikwete and under him, the whole top leadership of the country in how despite various incidences that could have shaken a country like Zimbabwe, have been keenly, firmly and assertively addressed here.
it's clear without a doubt, that it's as a result of his leadership style which is new to most of us, that we can see the various things that some of us believed won't happen.
in this approach, we believe this coming year 2009, we will see many prominent people standing in the dock.
all that is a historical connection between the wishes of the citizens and the courage of the rulers' leadership.
in all that has happened this year that have made us proud and of emerging from far to restore our dignity, we must confess that we too "can."
all these happenings and many others and as a result of various people's contributions to the public service and outside the country, we must again confess with our heads raised high with confidence that we can.
we can lead well!
we can argue, we can manage our resources, we can develop good strategies that we can implement, and that we can build a modern nation on our parent's land.
it is this courageous heart that we must cultivate in our people.
we should not be fast to rush out in search of solutions to our problems.
the issue of ATCL for instance is a matter that is within our might to attend to, as well as the issue on energy and some of the infrastructure are within our mandate.
this coming year, I fully believe that our main responsibility is to cultivate a spirit of confidence and commitment to national service.
I believe that within our youth, our children and adults, that thought of inferiority and incapability will be dealt with through action.
we will challenge ourselves to do all that we can do.
I believe that over 90 percent of our problems are within the abilities of our minds to resolving them, only if we will admit, confess and say that "we can."
as we enter this new year, instead of changing cars, houses or just sending good wishes for seeing a year new, let's really make up our minds to transform our nation and start rebuilding it.
we must go back to the basics this year and that is nation building.
that will however not get anywhere unless it is preceded with the transformation of our minds.
that, we must believe that we can!
not just criticizing, not just complaining, not just to seduce and ridicule, not just to write skillfully, not just being able to criticize each other and blackmail, but to be able to really build a modern nation that is a real nation of the people "who are free and equal!"
a nation that is the center of success for many people and the pride of its citizens!
and we can!
welcome 2009!
is it a must we all talk in one particular voice?
there is an issue that has been disheartening me whenever I'm listening to radio or television programs.
that issue is, the habit of some of the presenters especially of the entertainment programs imitating the voices of other prominent presenters.
in a surprising incident, you will hear a presenter of a particular program forcing to block their nose or talk fast while pronouncing English words with an objective of sounding like another presenter.
my belief is that it's not a must for a presenter to imitate the voice of his colleague if they want to succeed, but he can talk in his voice that he was born with and still be appreciated by his listeners or viewers.
Victoria. M, Temeke, Dar es Salaam
if your wife is untidy, wash her, don't complain
that high weight is a major reason that drives men to have a roving eye?
if you are a brother or a sister who thinks that way then you have misguided thoughts.
it is shocking to hear that women are the ones who spoil for themselves in relationships by adding weight arbitrarily, without considering modern dressing styles and to complain every time.
if you are one of 'those' who complain because your wife has grown fat?
what is it that caused the weight to increase?
when you met her for the first time you saw her with that problem or men who look at their wives and get disgusted by what they see, then don't put yourself on the list of real men.
the annoyance, she was a lady with the shape of a bottle?
that lady is the way she is because of bearing you children, the effects on hormonal systems from use of some birth control drugs.
whom do you think is happy to have that belly hanging on the body, even to a point they can't put on that modern jeans because of fat thighs?
instead of complaining first when you met.
about the issue of dressing, I am sure that many men who complain that their wives don't know how to dress, also have no idea concerning the cost of maintaining a lady.
how will you expect you wife to be with Pauline if you see that the weight annoys you then help your wife reduce by taking her everyday to exercise, and after a year ask me if that lady will not have started to regain her shape that attracted you, want her to shine in modern dresses when you don't even give her a single cent?
if you see that your wife's clothes do not excite you, take her to the shop and chose for her clothes that please you, and that is when you will know that the dressing preference your wife has is not to be ignored.
do ladies' complaints annoy you?
what does that lady complain about?
maybe it is three years now since you last bought her a handkerchief or a panty, and her complaining is a means of telling you that you have ignored her.
maybe her complaining results from a reason that the one hundred shillings you leave her everyday is not enough for domestic use.
maybe her complaining is a result of you leaving her all the responsibilities at home, while you satisfy the needs of prostitutes in brothels.
maybe that woman complains because she is tired of your behavior of unfaithfulness.
don't expose the nakedness of your wife to prostitutes by telling them how she doesn't satisfy you, as an excuse of having mistresses out there.
if she is dirty clean her up, if she is not appealing buy her make up.

according to Makonda, 10 percent of the region's population, have infections of elephantiasis and hydrocele, compared to other regions that are less than five percent.
the level is too big and alarming and the government and stakeholders should increase their energy, ensuring that these non-priority diseases are being finished in the region, where all those who are diagnosed with the disease should first be treated through surgery.
the motivation factor is that approximately 4,000 people, who have already been diagnosed with these diseases, will be undergoing surgery at each surgical centers in each district this week.

5.
let us stop misconceptions that if someone drinks these drugs, he cannot get a baby.
these drugs are safe and effective for human use.
the disease is spread with all sorts of mosquitoes, so let us clean up our environment to kill mosquitoes breeding places.
that way will make us safe from those diseases.
citizens come out in numbers for five days, to fight these diseases by taking immunizations.

Shilole opens up to friends who want to frustrate her relationship with Nuh Mziwanda!
bongo musician and bongo film maker, Zuwena Mohamed 'Shilole', has decided to clear the source of his dispute with her prospective husband, Nuh Mziwanda as friends.
Shilole claimed that they had often been fighting, but the source was a blurring statement from their close friends who aimed at separating them.
the lady claimed that from that situation, she has now decided not to involve them in any issue concerning her life in order to reduce frequent conflicts between them.
she said those around them are most likely to contribute to conflicts in their relationships, considering that they are now in the process of getting married after the parents of both sides accepted their relationship.
"we have noticed that friends are the ones coming between us because my boyfriend always receives information about me while they are the ones bringing me information about him, this has led to my need for many friends to be hypocrites," she said.
health services on the card still a test in Tabora
December 29, 2016 by Grace Chilongola in Central Zone
a section of Tabora town.
delay to start giving health services for the health procedure through card services (TIKA) in the Tabora municipal council compared to other municipals in the country has caused residents of that municipal to join in slow pace in that service.
since that service was started in the municipal council of Tabora the month of February, 2016, only 1,802 people who are equal to 4.7 percent are the ones who have joined that service until now.
Tabora Municipal has 229,000 residents and 44 health centers.
despite the Municipal and other towns registration started since 2014, in Tabora Municipal it started February 10, 2016 from the fact that Tabora councils, except the municipal did not have the Community Health Funds (CHF) and as a result of that state, the government instructed other municipals to join that service first and after that Tabora Municipal be incorporated in the TIKA services.
those supposed to join TIKA procedures are people from the age of five years where everyone is supposed to pay 10,000 per year.
the Tabora district commissioner Queen Mlozi has told Raia Mwema that the number of members increased from 92 that was there initially to 1,802 the month of November, 2016 thus increasing income from 920,000 shillings to 17 million shillings, an income that even though he has said is not satisfying.
card treatment services is a voluntary program that was started in municipals, towns and cities after the community health fund was determined to be not spreading well in its services in municipals and cities because of the nature of its rules which include that a patient is supposed to be treated in a health center where he did his payment from.
according to the district head, the government has started measures that involve all of its leaders from the level of ambassadors to district to encourage citizens to join that service.
other than government leaders, also leaders of religious denominations (Sheikh, pastors and padres) together with leaders of political parties will with involved in the influencing so that finally many citizens join TIKA.
"this is the great job we want to do, we have great faith in the work we are continuing with, citizens will comply since even councilors will be given a chance to encourage citizens on TIKA," said the head of district.
moreover, some of the councilors including the one for Chenye division in Tabora municipal have been leading examples after paying TIKA services for disabled citizens in their fields of work.
one of the actions taken by the government in growing the number of TIKA members includes influencing present citizens in the program to rescue poor villages which is headed by TASAF to be able to contribute to that service by contributing money in phases until getting to 10,000 shillings.
on his side, CHF director under National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) Silvery Gonza, said after the government starting many new councils, NHIF stood out firm in those councils so that they at least get CHF services.
instead of starting to change Tabora Municipal's CHF to be TIKA it is better to go the town council, for example Makambako which did not have that service completely as a result of its newness, therefore priority was to help new councils to start CHF and when we are done is when we start another phases of changing them in municipals and cities to be TIKA that is why we have delayed," he explained.
according to the director, the law that established Community Health Fund (CHF) is the one that started TIKA procedures in municipal, town and city councils.
some of the municipals that have joined TIKA up to know include Kinondoni council in Dar es Salaam, Bahati town municipal council in Manyara district, Makambako town municipal council, Njombe town municipal council, Tanga town and Tabora municipal.
however, activities of changing CHF to be TIKA have stopped after the government promised to make changes on CHF systems in the whole country at city level, district councils and municipal.
the implementation starts from 50 councils which are in the seven provinces including Tabora municipality that will give an opportunity for patients to be treated up to referral hospitals of different provinces and past days when a patient was receiving services only from where he was registered.
improvement procedures have reached a satisfying implementation step.
Nyerere, we are just as you left us
October 13, 2016 by Abdul Mkeyenge
two days from today, the father of the nation, Julius Kambarage Nyerere, will reach 17 years since he died on October 14, 1999.
the year 1999, I was very young.
I was a primary school pupil studying in class two.
these are so many years, not as few as you think.
the measure of the amount of this years is a record of soccer player Cesc Fabregas, who was very young in Arsenal and was given a chance to be the youngest player who has ever played in that team.
Fabregas and his jersey number 15, was given an opportunity to face men while he was only 16.
how can 17 years of the death of Mwalimu Nyerere be less?
17 years of that death has come like a joke and our games have continued to remain as they were during the time of the life of the father of the nation and apparently no one cares or is bothered.
it's not football that shows to have many stakeholders, but all of our sports generally has lacked excitement.
it's not the government that cares, not sports leaders who have lacked creativity, neither is it the fans who can encourage each other in the respective sports.
briefly, our sports are in ICU breathing through a machine.
since early in the year 1990, Ali Hassan Mwinyi, when he said our sports are the head of an insane person, there is no intentional efforts that have been made so that this statement does not stay alive, but lacking plans, this statement shall keep living until when we shall know where we were stuck.
our sports have a lot of plans which are on paper, but the truth of the matter is we have a long journey to get to where our fellows are.
third world countries just like Tanzania have spent 10 years or less to build their sports and after that period the country enjoys the fruits of investing in sports, but we are not this way and we don't show signs of getting from being like this.
our sports have endless disputes, when one sport's dispute ends, another dispute for another sport starts.
when you are in such a region it is difficult as a nation to succeed in whatever you are planning together.
if there will be success then it will be for an individual as it is for Mbwana Samatta.
Samatta has reached wherever he has reached by his own efforts and not a person or a party that helped him battle the whites right now.
as a country this is where we are.
it's only nationalism and heroism that can make you stay with a person from another nation and start praising our sports, but the real situation is useless and a result of the poor sports policy that we have.
before my grandfather and the former popular RTD anchor Mshindo Mkeyenge, followed wherever his companion Nyerere is, last year he was a journalist who was experienced in presenting and writing like me.
in Mkenyenge's presentation, he mostly announced the success of sports in Tanzania.
today you could hear him announce of Filbert Bayi, who performed well in athletics in the year 1974, tomorrow you could hear him announcing Peter Tino scoring a goal to move stars to play (AFCON) African nations, but for me life is not this way.
I use most of the time to inform people of disputes in sports.
since 1999 to 2016, we were supposed to be far in all the sports, but instead we keep sinking as a result of the problems we caused ourselves and we don't have anyone to blame, let us blame ourselves.
Cape Verde, Kenya and Uganda are close examples from those nations having succeeded in their various sports recently.
Cape Verde is a country that succeeded in football, whereas we once saw their struggles in building themselves and there is a time we scored them when we met.
but right now when you mention Cape Verde know you are mentioning a country with an assurance of qualifying AFCON tournament without worry.
Kenya is another country that once brought their athletics teacher to come in this country to be taught that sport, but today when you talk about athletics in East African zone you are talking about Kenya.
also Uganda's national football team will among the nations that will participate in AFCON tournament during the year.
how comes nations that were once behind us today are more than 50 steps ahead of us while we raise endless disputes?
the year 2016 is supposed to be the right time to put aside the disputes we have and to reflect generally on our sports so that we come with a right answer and our beginning of success to start from there.
it is a must as a nation to ask ourselves where have we stuck so that it becomes easy to get ourselves out, but if we continue as we are for several years, we shall come to meet again on this page as we celebrate the death of Nyerere and our sports to keep staying in this same chapter.
number of Ebola patients in Liberia declines
by AFP
Ebola Geneva, Switzerland the rate of new Ebola infection appears to decline in Liberia, but the tragedy still exists, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday.
"although the disease is still a threat to life in Liberia, infectious levels are decreasing," WHO Deputy Director Bruce Aylward told reporters in Geneva.
"there is a sign that states affected by this disease they can withdraw from this tragedy," he said.
Aylward was quick to add that his statement might be misinterpreted and some people begin to think that Ebola has been controlled in Liberia.
he said such a concept should not exist as originally the infections decreased but increased after several days.
Wednesday next week WHO will publish the number of deaths caused by Ebola epidemics which has affecting some West African countries while the number is expected to be over 5,000 people.
Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone nations are the most affected.
at the same time, the United States has ordered its army to return to home from West Africa be quarantined for 21 days.
this is happening as the United States struggles with preventing the spread of Ebola.
with AFP the action has led to the division between the US forces and other government agencies while the impression is that military forces have more strict conditions than those entrusted to health workers.
Aylward said cases of Ebola infection have increased to 13 703 from 10,000 cases reported by WHO on Saturday.
but he stressed that the increase was due to the inclusion in the figure of the number of cases which had previously been reported.
high number of deaths was reported in three states affected by the tragedy.
Liberia witnessed 6,535 cases, Sierra Leone had 5,235 cases and Guinea, where the disease occurred at the end of last year testified to 1,906 cases, he said.
in neighboring Mali, where a two-year-old girl died from Ebola after a bus ride from Guinea, any new infections have not been detected, he added.
Aylward said that data from different sources- including groups for organizing burial and medical centers, showed that the number of people being admitted to hospital for Ebola infection is declining in various parts of Liberia.
who threw a child arrested
by Gerald Bwisa
Uasin Gishu County Police have arrested a 25-year-old woman who was found throwing a one month old baby in a water well.
the woman was arrested yesterday by residents in the village of Kamagut shortly after throwing the baby in a water well.
it is alleged that she had left her husband a few days before doing the brutal act.
Missus Mercy Chirchir a resident in the village, who witnessed the act, said she was going to fetch water when she saw the woman throwing something into the well.
"it was late and I was going to draw water to prepare lunch for my children, I was just a few steps before coming to the well and saw the woman throwing something in when she saw me she went back to her house if she had not done anything," said Missus Chirchir.
she said she was shocked to find the baby floating on the water and she screamed at once to call the residents who arrived immediately.
the residents went to the woman's house and reprimanded her for her actions.
one old woman who witnessed the act objected to the act and asked girls who were unable to raise children to avoid the act of marriage or to go to hospital to be trained on using contraceptive methods.
she said in doing so they would avoid such brutal acts.
police took the baby's body to the mortuary at Moi Referral Hospital, Eldoret.
the woman is detained at Soy police station waiting to be charged.
elsewhere, body of a middle-aged man yesterday was found hanging at his home in Kameturi village, Bomet.

the chair that he used, was found under his feet.
the casual arrived at his home at eleven o'clock in the night after being drunk.
Chepkwony's mother, Missus Esther Taplule, said his wife had escaped for several weeks.
"he came home complaining.
we reassured him and he left.
we did not know it would the last time to see him," the woman who was flooded with tears told the National Today via telephone.

the government launches a special program to improve health.
written by Lucy Lyatuu.
published: 27th October 2016.
the government has launched a special program nationwide for improving healthcare known as the 1000 days package that will be used to implement various nutritional problems in the country with a purpose to reducing children nutritional disorders and insufficient blood in pregnant and breastfeeding women.
the 1,000 days package is a facilitative tool that uses various ways of communication aimed to influence behavioral changes and attitudes about nutrition in the community, creating awareness of the responsibility of parents and guardians who are within the first 1,000 days of human life that are counted since conception until the baby attains two years old.
at the launch of that plan, yesterday in Dar es Salaam city, the Permanent Secretary, Office of the President, regional administration and local government (TAMISEMI), Doctor Chainab Chaula said the 1000-days package will be introduced by the government as a special national package.
she said a program developed by the Good Start Nutrition project in collaboration with the Tanzania Food and Nutrition Center (TFNC) worked in six regions in the country that also helped to alleviate the problem of nutritional disorders.
regarding nutritional disorders, Doctor Chaula said it was an invisible phenomenon, although it is a threat to social, economic and need to be addressed and a solution found.
she said the government is planning to coordinate efforts made by stakeholders in the fight against any kind of nutritional disorders in the country.
she said the 1,000 days package will be used by various stakeholders as district and regional nutrition officials, community health workers to stimulate positive behavior aimed at reducing the problem of blood insufficiency in pregnant and breastfeeding mothers and nutritional disorders for children under the age of two.
she said emphasis has been placed on improving work and roles in society that are crucial in reducing nutritional disorders for mothers and children.
the executive director of the Food and Nutrition Institute, Doctor Joyce Kaganda said the 1,000 days package has six rooms each with a special identification mark, each room has been preserved with various publications promoting actions and positive nutritional behavior at each stage of growth development of the child.
of Kilimanjaro, Dodoma about girls is totally unacceptable
written by author
published: 18 November 2016
in this newspaper, we have written two articles that are in harmony relating to teenage pregnancy and sex in the provinces of Dodoma and Kilimanjaro.
all such sad news is a bad sign in the welfare and development of this nation.
in the first news from Dodoma, we were told that young girls from class three make love with drivers with big vehicles that are parked around Chalinze Nyama area, Chamwino district in Dodoma province.
and in the second news, we were told that secondary students in Kilimanjaro province are leading in school drop-outs resulting from pregnancy.
both the two reports that were based on a research that was authentically done and in the actual environment, are bad new to a nation that has set targets of elevating to the middle economy that relies on industries.
we are saying that because in whatever ways, the expected economic success in the society relies more on the ability and professionalism of the concerned individuals, who most of the time relay more on education.
that's to say, if the nation will continue to accumulate uneducated individuals because they deliberate decided to or formulated, going through tough hurdles of life for indulging in teenage love affairs and therefore stagnating or getting early pregnancy is evident the nation will have big losses since the workforce will not be educated and hence weak in issues that require technical skills.
together with urging parents to take proper control of morals and behaviors of their children, there is a great need to emphasize on reproductive health education to have a nation with youths who respect their bodies instead of abusing them through indulging like in an exploration field and be ruined by it.
we are saying that because, the statistics of Kilimanjaro province alone from January through to October this year shows that 216 girls in secondary have been impregnated, in Dodoma, in just one primary school, half of the girls who began from class one, did not graduate this year.
in fact, all that is happening can be categorized as sexual violence, a situation that is unacceptable and there is need to deal the problem with all might.
we are requesting everyone to help in monitoring our children to finish school as planed, rather than relegate a few institutions to undertake the persuasion which is disrupted by the exposed environment that have been overlooked by the parents.
how can it be that young grade three, four and form one pupils indulge in sex with drivers while we parents and guardians are present?
the meaning of this is very simple, we have left our young children to nurture themselves like indigenous chicken while we have failed to compete with the hawk who surround them all the time.
what we want to emphasize here is that all parents are guardians and should know where their children are and they should not joke around on this.
in the past, our forefathers despite having hard times and unfavorable living conditions, they managed to influence and nurture young boys and girls until they got to the stage of marrying or being married.
besides, it's good parents and guardians to restore parenting to their hands by ensuring they know where their children are within the whole 12-hour period.
we believe that if steps of these nature will be taken, it is evident that with the current speed, the future life of our daughters who are the most important symbols of the family anywhere in the world will be in doubt.
we love to believe that while the situation is bad, we are not too late to work hard to save the state of professionalism and civilization and to have a nation proud of its responsibility for its people who make themselves the key to the life of this nation.
the next constitution should resolve those who have and the poor III
June 25th, 2014.
last week I ended the article by saying the most important issue maybe than all is not the way we can be able to return to a community that is thought to live by just valuing humanity, but how we can be able to build humane foundations in this community which has been infected by valuing of things more.
in the last paragraph, I quizzed by asking: "how then can we be able to build systems which will ensure that together with this liberal democratic system, insists on the importance of people to live freely, think freely and seek things freely? how can we ensure that all people still respect the freedom and rights of everyone without caring about levels, religion, tribe, color, gender or disability?
these are not easy issues in our societies.
during the last article, I reviewed more the foreign ideas, thoughts and theories as they are the ones that have built the foundation of democracy that we are following today.
but as I said during the last article, before dictatorship, many areas here in Africa had its systems of operating its political, economical and societal matters.
and it's very bad luck that a foreign educational system brought to us did not help us a lot in building us into people who desire to quiz our own history.
in several surveys that took place in Africa, there is a big proof that ancient governance systems were not as dictatorial, cruel and lowly as the history written by those who called themselves inventors and later on the writers during and post colonialism tries to insinuate.
Paul Ansah of Ghana (in his publication the year 1988) says there is a lot of proof showing that even before the coming of colonialism, many communities in Africa had systems that were following democratic foundations that we are seeing today.
that scholar says, "the members of a traditional council allowed discussion and a free and frank expression of opinions and if there were disagreements, they spent hours, and even days if necessary, to argue and exchange ideas until they reached unanimity".
his interpretation is that members of a traditional council (who today are like councilors, ministers, parliamentarians et cetera) had a system that allowed free discussions which focused on the rights of everyone.
where there was a disagreement in argument, then they stayed for several hours and even when compelled, they stayed for several days arguing and discussing until the time they reached an agreement.
end of interpretation.
those who follow the Ghanaian and Nigerians cinemas will understand that even Igwe (king) doesn't just make a decision without the presence of a discussion and his council of advisers.
Ansah says there was an understandable notion on the importance of people to express themselves freely as proven by sayings, proverbs, the tradition of ancient courts and other things like songs, group poems, poems, drama, tales et cetera.
but according to the writer (Kerr in his 2001 book and Ngcongco 1989) before independence, the Tswana (of Botswana) had a system known as kgotla (dikgotla in plural) whose work was to bring citizens together (like in the markets or in open fields) to make a joint decision like designing laws, listening to advice or complaints, to punish wrongdoers and giving information.
Kerr says that the kgotla leader was known as Kgosi or Mong of kgotla and that as the community became bigger, the number of the divisions was increased and assigned much more dikgotola to enable the citizens to meet, to share information and make decisions.
if you read the history of the Kikuyu for example, you will understand that they had systems that allowed communal issues to be driven on the foundations of listening to others and giving justice.
that is why in many African communities the biggest and important attribute for a person to be a leader was not just tyranny.
it was his wisdom in listening and issuing just decisions to all community members.
but as it was in Athens, Greece with its democracy of approximately 2,400 years ago, even in Africa some groups did not have an equal voice with some other groups.
in Greece for example, slaves or women were not counted as citizens with equal rights to participate in their democracy of decision.
similarly, even in Botswana, Kerr explains this shortcoming by saying, "with the exception of restrictions in terms of ethnicity and gender on free participation, the Tswana kgotla as a public assembly operated in a fairly democratic fashion, in that it checked and restrained the powers of the leaders".
if you sleep completely, you will miss out on a rare occurrence.
by Leonard Onyango.
Kenyans who love to sleep soundly until sunrise might miss out on a rare opportunity to see five planets which have been sighted every dawn since January 20th, this year.
Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn have been sighted every dawn between 5.30 and 6.00 in the morning all over the world.
according to Jane Platt from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), anyone can be able to see those planets without using special glasses or telescope.
"the planets look like stars but they are brighter (they are shiny) compared to other normal stars," said Platt through a report that was uploaded to the NASA's website, www.nasa.gov.
this is the first time for these planets to be seen together in a period of the past 10 years.
this means that those who miss out on seeing those planets before February 20th, will have to wait until July 2020 when they will be sighted again.
on January 28th, the world witnessed those planets shining together with the moon in the morning.
according to NASA, if you wake up too early, you might miss out on seeing Mercury which usually rises late and also sets first.
between those five planets, Venus is the brightest compared to the others.
on February 10th, those planets will be seen closer to each other via a distance in degrees from one planet to another.
those who will use telescopes to look at those planets will succeed to see four big moons surrounding planet Jupiter.
those moons, Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto were seen for the first time by Galileo in the year 1609.
the institution has already released photos showing the view of those planets every dawn between January 20th and February 20th.
the moon of this world will be 'moving' from one planet to another.
on the dawn of February 27th and 28th, the moon will be close to Jupiter and on February 1st, it is expected to be close to Mars.
on February 3rd, it will be seen together with Saturn and Venus will shine together with the moon on February 5th.
finally, Mercury will shine together with the moon on February 6th.
for the planets to be well seen, the weather conditions must be clear without clouds and the viewer is supposed to stand on a raised area.
"the person who wants to view the planets well, doesn't have a choice but to stand on a raised area and direct his eyes towards the southern sky," said Platt.
those planets were last seen together between December 2004 and January 2005.
Platt says that Mercury and Venus might not be visible in some of the areas in July 2020 when those planets become visible again.
scientists are saying that those planets are usually visible after 10 years because that is the time when all the five planets are in line when rotating the sun.
the NASA equipment has ever explored all those planets that are visible.
"we are proud of the high level American technology that has helped us understand a lot about planets," said Jim Green, the director of Planet Science Faculty at NASA.
according to Green, the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are the only ones that can be viewed without using glasses or telescope from earth.

Sitta is a leader by example - Kafulia
written by Regina Kumba
published: 08 November 2016
David Kafulila who used to be the Member of Parliament for South Kigoma has cried for he who used to be the Speaker of the Ninth Parliament and retired Member of Parliament for East Urambo District in Tabota province, Samuel Sitta, saying that Tanzania has lost a role model leader for all parties.
speaking in Dar es Salaam City yesterday, Kafulila said Sitta was a role model leader because he has left big issues, which he stood for without being threatened by someone.
"in truth, I can say that our country has lost a big leader who could not be threatened in his stand, he will continue to be remembered for those things that he stood for and they will remain in the people's memory," said Kafulila.
he said Sitta is his close elder and he made him part of his family, even in the Jubilee celebration of commemorating 50 years of marriage, he invited him as a family member.
in addition, he said in politics, Sitta made a record in standing for what he believes in for a long time, an element that is very scarce among other leaders and elders of this nation.
"is the reason why he differed with the first term President, Julius Nyerere, Sitta is being chased away from Dar es Salaam University there, but he did not change his stand and later he was taken back and caned," explained Kafulila.
he said when Sitta was the Speaker of the Ninth Parliament, retired President Jakaya Kikwete addressed the Parliament about corruption, but Sitta appeared to differ with him without any fear.
"therefore, this leader and role model elder used to stand for what he believes in," said Kafulila and added that the disaster is very big in the hearts of people who understand his stand and also to the nation.
he said that the ninth parliament which he led, he created procedures of parliament which made that parliament become one that has teeth and an example, which made people love following on it.
Kafulila wanted youths to stand in the politics he was in, believing Sitta since when he was Speaker of Parliament, he did well with the opposition parliamentarians by being equal and he made them get a hearing together with their shortage in parliament.
"is the principle of democracy, the majority to decide, but also the minority be given a chance to be heard," said Kafulila.
Martin Madekwe: construction of affordable housing is a major challenge May 24, 2012
National Housing Corporation (NHC) is among the few public organizations and old remaining in the country, having been providing services since the early years of Tanganyika independence.
in this article, NHC General Director, Martin Madekwe, answers questions about the organization and its challenges, as our author, Aristariko Konga reports.
question: what is the origin of the National Housing Corporation (NHC)?
answer: the origin of the National Housing Corporation (NHC), which was established in 1962, just one year after our independence, was to help access affordable housing, especially in urban areas.
that is why immediately after the Government's established the corporation, at the time, it provided funding to the Organization to enable it to build as many houses as possible.
using the subsidy, the corporation could perform slum clearance, especially in Dar es Salaam and build concrete houses and roof them using iron sheets.
thus were constructed the houses of Ilala, Magomeni, Mwananyamala and others.
similar construction was also spread throughout all regions and districts.
however, this trend changed over the eighty's due to economic change, where the government stopped funding the corporation.
following the move, the corporation was obliged to invest its own revenue, which was largely from taxation.
and by 1990 the government found it wise to strengthen the National House Corporation by joining it to the House Registrar, a corporation created in 1971 for managing finalized houses.
that is how the current National Housing Corporation was instituted at Law Number 2 of the 1990s.
the corporation's goals have remained the same - building or facilitating the construction of a proper residential and commercial houses.
however, due to lack of funding like in the past, the corporation is now self-reliant on business grounds.
question: what is the difference between the NHC in the past, when the economy is regulated by the government and this era of economic independence and globalization?
answer: as mentioned above, the corporation was receiving subsidies from the government.
currently, at this time of economic independence, the corporation is no longer subsidized.
so, right now it is obliged to run by following all the business principles that are governed by market power.
an example here is rent from the corporation houses.
in the past, the rent was very low due to government subsidies.
we are now obliged to increase rent rates to suit market change.
the goal is to get money to pay for the operation, maintenance of the relevant houses, build new houses together with paying taxes to the government.
question: which organization in the housing industry are your main competitors, who probably deprive you of sleep?
answer: we do not have competitors who deprive us of sleep.
all those emerging like PPF, NSSF and others, count them as our partners in our efforts to increase residential and commercial housing in the country.
this is due to the fact that housing demand in the country is very serious.
National Housing Corporation alone cannot satisfy.
the organization would like to see the private sector really contributing to real estate developers to build houses.
it is in this way that we can reduce the high shortage of housing in the country.
the corporation would like to see more competition in the housing sector.
competition increases efficiency, increases productivity and thus manages housing shortages.
competition brings challenges to each other to do the best work.
question: recently there have been calls for organizations to build affordable houses for the benefit of ordinary citizens.
what does NHC do about it?
answer: these actions exist.
these are legitimate legal actions and the corporation is very eager to respond to these actions.
construction of affordable houses requires funding for cheap interest or subsidies be available.
in recent years the corporation is building either for its own capital or loan.
corporation's capital is very limited.
house rent is very low.
the rent is used for maintenance and operation activities of the corporation.
remaining extra amount after taxation of the income and shareholder's share (the Government) is the remainder of which is directed to construction.
commercially you will have to build houses that will be able to repay your expenses.
bank loans have great interest.
if you are building on loan you will need to sell the houses at a great price.
in addition, the cost of purchasing construction materials is great.
in order to build affordable houses it is necessary for the corporation to be enabled.
affordable funds be available, the corporation be enabled to borrow at cheap interest or receive subsidies from the government as it was in the 1960s and 1970s.
the corporation or anyone building low-cost houses be enabled to purchase affordable construction materials.
this includes removing Value Added Tax (VAT) on building materials and other incentives.
building squares be available in bulk, with structural designs.
roads be built by the respective municipalities, which when the houses are completed they get property tax.
water be taken to the construction sites and by relevant institutions.
electricity should be provided as well by relevant institutions because at the end of the day they will benefit from the payment of those services.
if all this happens, the corporation or any other builder can build affordable houses.
question: what challenges do you face as a corporation?
answer: one major challenge is building many houses to reduce housing problems, and in particular building affordable housing for ordinary people.
the corporation also has to sell or rent its houses at low costs.
but as noted above, the corporation is buying construction materials in the same market with other homeowners.
another challenge is the renovation of its houses.
for many years the corporation failed to build its houses due to small income generated by the rent of its houses being very low.
question: what would you like to tell your tenants or customers?
answer: fulfill their responsibility by paying their rent in accordance with their renting agreements.
in addition, work hard to take care of the houses they live in and their surroundings.
tenants should understand that they have been lucky to get the corporate's houses.
most citizens need these houses.
so, they must pay their rent fully so that the corporation can renovate the houses they live in and build others so that other Tanzanians can also get the corporate's houses.
question: many public organizations, either they are struggling economically or have died completely.
how did NHC come where you are and kept alive?
answer: we have come here we are as a result of good cooperation between the Ministry, Board, corporate's leadership and staff.
in addition, we have had good plans, in terms of the use of our resources, namely staff (human resources) and our houses.
we have been able to make the existing repairs, and we have also been able to build other houses, either in our currency or in venturing with other investors.
in terms of human resources, we have encouraged all employees to convince them that the corporation is in line with their lives.
so, they are very dedicated to work.
question: how many houses does NHC have and how many tenants are there all over the country today?
answer: NHC owns 2231 buildings with 15,967 tenants.
question: what action do you take against tenants and your resistant creditors?
answer: we are removing them from the houses in accordance with Parliament Act Number 11 of 2005, which states that a tenant who may not pay his or her debt within 30 days after being notified, then he is charged with court proceedings.
he will also give him a 14-day notice.
after that he will be removed from the house and his items will be auctioned to cover the debt claimed.
this law has greatly helped the corporation to collect its house's rent and thus increase its income.
question: take this opportunity to explain some things that you think Tanzanian public should know about NHC.
answer: NHC is a public institution, which was established with a view to helping solve the issue of housing in the country.
we will continue to fulfill our responsibility according to our ability.
currently, big effort is made to make repairs in our homes.
many cities have begun appealing.
we are building houses for sale and renting.
however, the direction of the corporation is now more focused on the construction houses for sale.
the corporation believes it will succeed in the construction of new houses after two key rules in the housing sector were approved recently by Parliament.
these laws apply to mortgage loans, namely mortgage financing (Special Provisions Act Number 2 of 2008).
this law will allow more people to borrow money from banks to buy a house.
with many buyers, the corporation will also be assured of the housing market that it builds.
in addition, the second "Unit Tittle" law will also allow the citizens to buy a piece of housing in large buildings.
the buyer will obtain a title deed for the section purchased and thus be in a position to use it as a guarantee to obtain loans from banks.
the corporation is strong in building apartment buildings and thus sells houses in bulk.
thus, the direction of the corporation is good, it will continue to grow by building many houses for sale and enabling more citizens to have their own houses.

Mugabe, his companions are a big bother Africa.
how can someone rule a country for three decades, hit the age of 90 and still prepare plans to contest for the presidency by 2018 when he has 94 years?
even though he who gives and takes life is God, I am not sure if I say that of Mugabe is a plan to die in power, history is written that old age separated him from the country.
a recent incident whereby the party of Zanu-PF appointed President Mugabe to contest for the presidency in the coming four years, is proof that he has no intention of retiring, to see Zimbabwe being led by someone else.
and as if to remind those desiring to succeed him, it is treason to do that, Mugabe sacked Vice President Joice Mujuru.
Missus Mujuru was believed to be among very famous people in that country, who were expected to take the reins of power when old Mugabe follows the way of answering a greeting.
not only that!
others who are stalking the leadership of Zanu-PF in order to succeed Mugabe, AIS Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe is a big shame for an African!
and not Mugabe only, there are many who are stuck in leadership like those glued down, if he leaves power suddenly - maybe if he only dies - were shown signs that their ambitions won't be tolerated.
it is in that regard whereby the wife of that president, Missus Grace Mugabe, was given a high position in the party to lead women.
rumor says she is being prepared to succeed her husband!
while that continues in Zimbabwe, our neighbor Yoweri Kaguta Museveni of Uganda said, Ugandans don't want him to retire because whenever elections are held, he can't miss ten million people who give him votes.
that is another dictator who, since he overthrew the government in 1986, has believed that the citizens love him more than they love their country.
similar to President Mugabe, Museveni has been suspected to prepare his wife Janet or his son Muhoozi to lead Uganda.
the same situation is like that in Rwanda whereby President Paul Kagame, who has been in power since 1994, is believed to hold on to the position of the presidency as he waits for his son to mature in order to hand it to him.
Kagame, who once said that he would like to retire by 2016 then said there was no one qualified, has been quiet for a long time concerning that announcement.
like other dictators of Africa who believe only their families are the ones who can succeed them, the big he is doing Kagame is to kill his opposition who seem to have a major influence in that country.
it is surprising to see that they don't learn anything as a result of incidents of years not many ago in the continent of Africa.
the late President Muammar Gaddafi of Libya made the people tired of him and finally, he was killed while continuing to prepare his son Seif al-Islam to succeed him.
former Egyptian dictator, Hosni Mubarak, was removed from power as he prepared his young son Gamal to take over leadership as he leaves.
the problem of leaders who take themselves to be the best in their countries, to a level of believing it's only they who can give birth to leaders, is that they believe the greatest enemy is in the opposition.
they use a lot of time, fighting their political opponents who announced themselves openly, they forgot the say of the wise men that, what eats you is within you.

executive in custody for misuse of public funds
written by Veronica Mheta, Longido.
published 26 October 2016
the manager of the council of Longido district, Juma Mhina has commanded the district police to arrest and imprison Galai Lumbwa's ward executive, Paulo Lucas, accused of misusing money contributed by the residents in the region with an aim of improving educational sector.
after Lucas evaded police time after time, finally yesterday the directive was implemented in the village of Ilchang Sapukin in the ward of Galai Lumumba, during the public meeting of Arusha's provincial commissioner Mrisho Gambo.
before Lucas was arrested, citizen Anni Mollel thanked Gambo for going to the region to witness the real state of the construction of the Secondary school for which the citizens raised funds of more than 96 million shillings, but funds were not spent as intended, instead government leaders and village chairpersons used them for their own benefit.
after Mollel's speech, Gambo asked director Mhina why they have not taken legal steps to arrest the accused, that is when Mhina said in public that the directive was initially impossible after Lucas escaped the director time after time.
he was arrested yesterday at that meeting.
the council's internal auditor, Mwajuma Mndaira, in her report that she released in the meeting said that she had a discussion with the village chairmen to establish why they collected money from citizens without using documented receipts.
she also said that they are currently continuing with inspection of the documents and complaints to determine who Lucas colluded with and why did he change some of the uses since some of the tourist hunting companies including Wingert Windrose Safaris (WWS) and Kilombero Nothern Safaris company gave 400 bags of cement for the construction of a secondary school.
she said when they were at the site where the secondary school is being built, they determined that despite the bags of cement being given, only 44 had been used while 144 had been sold and they claimed that they sent another 216 bags to the construction of labs and classrooms which were dilapidated.
also, after doing the initial investigation, she directed the Civil Engineer to go to that place to evaluate the construction to determine whether it was really used in that construction or not since that executive took some of the resources and sold them knowing that it was against the intended purposes.
Gambo questioned the executive as to why the citizens did not have a Secondary school.
he said that children from pastoral communities and others need education and they walk long distances to look for education while he (Lucas) and other leaders misuse public funds.
Lucas in his defence said that the funds were used correctly and he was forced to divert some of the funds to build laboratory buildings, a kitchen, dormitories and others.
he continued defending himself that he used the funds together with other leaders in helping the construction of the secondary school which is not yet complete.
charging fine for the corrupt has saved the disable persons on June 01, 2012.
there was arrangement of exchange of debate in the Chama Cha Mapinduzi party because of several reasons among being the political leaders creating political networks and engaging in corruption while others are giving inciting statements outside this party, then any the an action will be taken by the good citizens has being addressed.
two big thing is expected to come out in that party.
first, leaders who are suspected to involve in corruption disciplinary and legal action must taken against them.
two, those who talk outside the party sitting among them members of parliament they shall be given warning and they should be careful.
already at that time there are those who started opposing among were some of the Secretariat of that party and whose chair is the secretary general Yusuf Makaba of CCM party.
apart from the secretary general of CCM, the secretariat is made up of the assistants of the secretary generals of CCM who are Saleh Ramadhan (Zanzibar) and George Mkuchika (mainland), the secretary of NEC of National organization, Kidawa Yusuf Hamid, the secretary national executive committee of ideology and expansion John Chiligati, the secretary national executive committee of political issues and international relations, Bernard Membe and the the secretary national executive committee of economics and finance, Amos Makala.
the responsibility of the secretariat of the national council is to organize all the activities of the party CCM at the national and also organize the national sittings at the national level.
according to the information we got of meeting of secretariat which was held in Dar es Salam recently, large number of the delegates support that the party should held responsible for those members who involve in corruption and they become burden to the party after they were taken action by agencies.
however, it is being explained that in the same session also it planned the main committee of CCM, to meet January 3 this year and NEC to meet for two days 25 and 26 in Dodoma city, it is only one delegate who was seen as protecting the suspects of corruption who for along time have been involved to benefit from them but his protests did not change the position of his fellow delegates who are many.
but when the situation is like that, it is explained by the personnel of the highest level in the government who have been supporting that decision that is expected to be done in that party and some being ready to embrace blames of leadership this is a step of separating President Kikwete with hatred that can come from what we call "hard decision"
more reports are explaining that the situation of discussing the suspects of corruption being mentioned that they personal strategies so much that it has been disturbing that party it is annoying and tiresome to many leaders who are faithful in the government and other questioned, "them (by their name) who are they in this country until they make people to lack sleep?"
our sources of information that are near to the senior leaders in the country they have suggested that the step being taken so as to clean CCM before the platforms of campaigns later this year.
that direction of reaching to "hard decisions" is mentioned to be involved with that what is expected to emerge from the report of the committee of the retired President, Ali Hassan Mwinyi.
the Mwinyi's committee that joins Deputy Chairman of CCM, Pius Msekwa and the delegate of the main committee of CCM, Abdulrahman Kinana, which was created by NEC during its previous sitting in Dodoma city so as to offer suggestions of finishing what was mentioned as enmity among the members of parliament of that party together with the delegates of the councils' representatives from Zanzibar who had contradictory statements with senior leaders of the government of union.
it is already been reported that there is a situation of conflict in they way they look at each other among the delegates of that committee in the preparation of the report and because of that conflict, the delegates of the committee are preparing a different report that they will present to the CCM secretariat.
the real situation on the direction of CCM during the general elections later this year, it is expected to have a lot of complains if that party will not make any decision which has been posted with a name "hard decision" by separating with the suspects of acts of corruption, who are already are responsible in the government.
some of the senior leaders of CCM are involved in major incidents of corruption, including theft of billions of funds from the Overseas Debt Account (EPA), Central Bank of Tanzania (BoT) and some of them are already in court and their case are going on, included is the Secretary of Finance and Economy of CCM, Kigoma province, Rajabu Maranda.
aside from the senior officials of that party, there is a claim also that it has been contributed funds for election by some of the businesspeople who are involved in the acts of Corruption in the country, who some have also been taken to court.
already the situation of there being a split is obvious not only among members of parliament but even among the government leaders and especially ministers.
at the end of the year, the committee of Mwinyi was ever reported by some of the media house that it has started to breakdown, while it explained that there is a part of suggestions in her report of together because of the submission of NEC-CCM has been leaked.
in those information, it explained that some of the leaders of CCM has suggested about the recommendation that committee, that was claimed is together with removing those who are in power and some are suspects.
from those recommendations of removing some of the senior officials they are mentioned to a tendency of protesting with committee on the claims that the step is intense, without caring who they will leave in power so that they can remain as normal members they have already done that by leaving their positions in the government.
it is ideal time for TFRA to control the rise in fertilizer prices
written by editor
published: 22 November 2016
we all know that In order to cope with extreme poverty in the country, this nation needs to ensure that activities being undertaken by 80 percent of its people living in rural areas are successful.
these citizens who live more reliably on agriculture should stop relying on small hand hoes for farming in migrant cultivation so that they can satisfy themselves in food and sell others for the day.
in addition, Tanzanians we should realize that in promoting welfare and poverty alleviation, there is a significant link between poverty, food security and nutritional problems, and all these find solutions in modern agriculture.
we understand that this nation has been in the process of rehabilitation in order to bring rural development in line with the fact that it has long been developing a number of strategies to facilitate rural change.
throughout the era of poverty alleviation strategies, something far more commonly spoken is changing to modern agriculture through the use of modern fertilizer.
as a result, it is obviously the call of the Minister of Agriculture, Veterinary Affairs and Fisheries, Doctor Charles Tizeba, to call for the Tanzania Fertilization Authority (TFRA) to reduce agricultural costs in the country, including the control the rise of fertilizer prices, has come timely.
launching a new TFRA board, that will be led by Doctor Mshindo Msolla, yesterday in Dar es Salaam, Doctor Tizeba said for some time now, there is no standard fertilizer price a matter which makes the government to use billions of finances as a subsidy for fertilizers, the aim being to reduce the big burden of the high fertilizer cost to farmers.
that is to say, if there was a standard price, the high cost of production in the agricultural sector could be reduced and therefore farmers would be persuaded to use fertilizer in order to get more income.
in order for us to be successful, it is good for that board to listen to the minister especially his directive that he gave of wanting to go through a new the fertilizer act and to look at areas that are not friendly in order to come up with a combined fertilizer buying system, that will make it possible to bring down the price of fertilizer while genuine fertilizer is available.
we believe that by removing barriers, the board will be able to monitor closely the production processes and the importation of fertilizer in order to make farmers use quality fertilizers and those that bring worthy profits.
we believe that time has come for this nation to ensure that it does not oppress its farmers and through these farmers, we have enough raw materials to go to the middle economy.
so it is best to ensure that the farmer does not buy fertilizer that is a fake.
we like to believe the words of Chairman of the board, Doctor Msolla, that his board is prepared to confront all defects in the fertilizer industry in order to ensure that farmers get quality fertilizers at affordable prices, and in this we advise other stakeholders to continue to provide cooperation to enable our farmers to have quality fertilizer again at an affordable price.

West Africa awed by the Swahili culture shown by Diamond in the video 'I say to you, I say to you'
African culture
the video shows the culture of a Swahili from the coast who has inherited many things from the Arabs.
these are the things that Africa and the whole world have learned from colonial history.
through the video and his song, Diamond has given fans in Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa and other countries outside of East Africa, the true picture of a Swahili's way of life.
Taarab and Mduara are songs with Tanzania origins and therefore a song such as 'I say to you' represents what we can proudly call Tanzanian music.
the act of incorporating the country's media queen Khadija Kopa, has added great value to the song.
not forgetting to mention that Khadija Kopa and Hanscana have been placed where now the eye of Africa is seeing them.
these are new concepts for countries like Nigeria and Ghana.
these are things that their artists do not give them because it is not their culture.
that's why as well as not understanding Kiswahili they are still drawn to the video and the song because they are listening to new tunes and seeing different pictures.
"I don't understand a single word but Diamond is honestly as his name says."
loyal fan from Namibia.
"#teamdiamond," wrote Rauha Vroutjie.
yesterday Diamond's name was successful in attaining the first position on the trend topics on Twitter's website just a few hours after releasing the video.
for a Tanzanian artist to to trend in Lagos, Nigeria is not a common thing, it's great.
Diamond has crossed the point of being a famous artist in Tanzania alone and has become a popular artist in Africa.
if he lands in Luanda, Angola or Gaborone, Botswana, without doubt many will recognize his face.
the part he has reached, he has the ability to do any song and Africa will understand him.
creating a song with Tanzanian flavor is the best decision he has made.
therefore the emphasis I would like to make here is that we cannot intimidate the Nigerians who are currently the champions of music in Africa, if we imitate their music and give them the same flavor as given by their artists.
they can not be shocked
consider this example.
if you are a resident of Bukoba and you've come to visit your brother in Dar es Salaam, then bananas being the only food that he gives you, how would you feel?
you have left bananas filled to the brim in Bukoba only to come to Dar and get served bananas again?
ponder.
therefore artists who are lucky to associate with great artists from Nigerian or South Africa, in order for their collaboration to be seen to be meaningful they need to create songs with Tanzanian flavor so as to give a different tune to the lovers of that music.
for those artists who have had the luck of acquiring big names, if they want to be taken seriously they should make sure they compose songs in universal genres which include Hip Hop, R&B or Pop
they should compose songs with original Tanzanian flavor, namely Bongo Flava.
if a Tanzanian does Kwaito or Nigerian music I feel that he would not get anywhere.

60 compete in NMB golf
written by Mohamed Akida
published: 31 October 2016
the NMB golf competitions, Monthly Mug, have been held during the weekend on Lugalo golf courses, where a total of 60 players competed.
those tournaments that are being sponsored by NMB bank, are held every end of the month in that field, involving star players of NMB and Jeshi Lugalo teams.
speaking during the tournament, captain of the NMB Golf Club, George Kivaria, said the tournament has been the same every month, with superiority and competitiveness enhanced.
Kivaria said that the tournament involves senior and junior teams, whereby in the morning it's the seniors' turn and during the day until evening it is the juniors' turn.
he called on the players of the game to come out in numbers to participate in the NMB Monthly Mug since they have become a free platform of golf stars to improve their game levels.
he challenged Tanzanians who fear that game, thinking it is for the rich, by telling them NMB has erased that status and turned it to be a game that can be played by all communities.
"NMB sponsorship in this competition has changed the image of golf.
it is now being played by low-level people, who were previously scared of this game," said Kivaria.
Michael Misabo, who is a player of the NMB squad showed clearly that the competition in that tournament is big while asking various golf stars to join them.
"here are two teams of Jeshi Lugano and NMB.
this is of army Lugalo involves military offices and soldiers, but this of NMB involves civilian players.
"so civilian players should volunteer to join us in these end month tournaments, which through NMB sponsorship has made it competitive," he said.
everyone's right to life should be respected.
the right to life as clarified in the constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania of the year 1977.
this is one of the basic things which are supposed to be respected by everyone.
this right relates to God's creation as explained in the holy books.
in short, human beings are the ones who put the authority principles in the world.
section 8 (1), has been clearly clarified that the United Republic of Tanzania is a country that follows democracy principles and societal rights and therefore, (a), the citizens are the principles of all authority and the government will get all its governance and authority from the citizens in accordance to the constitution, (b), the main objective of the government will be the welfare of the citizens and (c), the government will be accountable to the citizens.
I have started with a few sections of the constitution which gives rights and accountability to the citizens and the leaders who vow to protect it, so as to build the basis of my analysis.
recently, there were incidents where seven corpses tied in sacks were collected from River Ruvu, which aroused many questions with a need for answers as this was not normal.
they are disturbing because the statement by the Minister for Internal Affairs Migulu Nchemba earlier said that they were illegal immigrants, while the statement by the Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa, later on, asked for investigations to be done quickly.
the order concerns the minister who had already given an answer without investigation, what should we expect?
their answers are doubtful because, it is not possible to give simple answers to heavy issues involving people's lives.
apart from those killings, reports were made about the killings of people inside the Serengeti National Park who are suspected to have entered for the purpose of poaching.
those are incidents where some of the witnesses came out to talk of but comprehensive investigation has not been done.
the government's silence against such incidents makes citizens who have put it in power to lose faith with some of the actors, because a person's life is fundamental and should be accorded its weight.
if a human being's first right is to life, how is it possible for murder incidents not to be accorded weight by the government as they do when elephants and rhinos die?
such conditions are the ones that truly give the interpretation that citizens are the principle of all authority!
we witnessed when the rhino George famous as JK's rhino was killed, there was a big operation that cost two peoples' lives and others injured who were involved or not involved in those killings and the government stayed silent about the incidents.
the rhino John's issue has emerged, a huge expenditure is being utilized to follow up on including conducting a DNA on the bones, so as to attach it to his horns to verify if he is indeed the one who died, but human killings who by have elected them by principle are not given the same weight.
there are many incidents of citizens being killed by elephants which invade farms and human settlements, when they happen, you might not see any government leader arriving at the incident area but if an elephant is killed, the area is not enough because some arrive even in helicopters to search for the killers.
for whom are we conserving these animals if those supposed to benefit from their fruits are being killed and the government ends up giving just sentiments while it is officially silent?
it should remember that its silence when that issue is bearing orphans and widows who at times are forced to bear the burden through different programs like Tasaf is not right.
you will hear government leaders saying they do not want to borrow or beg from outside, but they are not dealing with the difficulties causing the existence of the groups that need aid.
the fifth term government distinguished itself to speak for the poor, well and good but which poor are these if people are killed by animals and complain being killed inside the national park and it doesn't focus its energy to determine the truth, now which vulnerable are they speaking for?
I beg to be understood clearly that I am not supporting people who are sabotage public property like poaching, but that doesn't take away the fundamental legal right.
they are required to be heard and the law to take its course, otherwise those meeting punishment against others outside the court are violating the law and human rights.
also, I am not happy with the way the government uses a lot of force when an elephant or rhino is killed, but doesn't use the same force when a human being is killed.
it is good for government actors given the good will by the citizens to accord special weight to the right to live issue by ensuring its protection.
strict measures should be taken for those violating it because their existence results from the citizens.

what makes you move from your environment?
if I don't understand what you are saying and understand what you mean, then every time, we will problems.
we won't be able to get a good platform of us together to meet and discuss challenges that we meet together, that confront us in our communication.
this is one of many challenges.
we don't understand each other, at other times language is really really hard
not only abroad, even here at home, people can speak until their color changes but there is no agreement.
and many times all these are as a result of individualism.
and individualism is a result of upbringing.
if it is your characteristic, upbringing will rub it in and give you a base and guideline of life to help you and to enable you to fight that self.
it's like religion in the society, one job that it has taken is the development of communal work, now everything you leave to the Almighty to help you and give you strength.
this system of helping you personally and you to be able to help the society has come from where and in what language that has been brought is foreign culture and our traditions.
in our original upbringing or those cultures and traditions of these sides, individualism is something that isn't in our upbringing.
humanity is something that was one of the pillars of the community.
we have come here to look for life.
many of us never understood language, culture, and traditions of this place or to understand the life here before coming, it has been explained to them by someone or people.
by bad luck or good, to be explained to is not like seeing and having a personal experience.
what makes you move from the environment you are used to and go to another far country and you don't understand culture or tradition, it's selfish.
here you meet a very different environment more than there where you came from, crops and until the weather is different.
the food, smell, the clothes they wear or how they wear them, northern Europe abroad is different.
when the cold season comes and the whole country is under ice, just keep wondering at how different the environment is and how the coldness hits you, there is no single day when you will be prepared for an environment like this.
first just how darkness covers like a mat this part of the world and continues in that condition until the third month from the month of 10.
two thirty is already dark and the day breaks at two thirty or nine o'clock in the morning.
it's nearly six hours only that you get the sunshine (if it will come out).
this condition continues starting the month of 10 until the third month.
after those months, the day breaks at four o'clock in the afternoon and for 17 hours and ends at nine o'clock at night until the tenth month.
don't think that, this comes once just like how you switch on and switch off light.
it comes step by step until at the peak which is the month of June 21 and 22 which is known as the middle of the hot season (midsummer).
slowly, after that darkness returns until the days of the sun become few and darkness rules to reach the peak of darkness whereby you get just a few hours of sunshine on December 12. December 21 or 22 and sunshine slowly returns until the peak again of June.
that is the condition of our lives here abroad.
northern Europe celebrates twelve days of the cold season.
those days are called "Julhelg" which are like four days among those we call Christmas.
culture and traditions of northern Europe in their homes they put a Christmas tree, Christmas flowers.
all this are as a result of their old culture and traditions before Christ and they included them in religion.
it was brought to us and we copied without knowing from whence it came.
we go to celebrate "Christmas" but they are cultures and traditions of Europe which were there before the Christian faith.
the best rice cultivation.
Imani Lubaba.
rice is among the most widely cultivated produce in the world and is also among the most popular products for people from their food and delicious juice.
today I will give you a guide on how to cultivate rice like an expert so as to harvest a lot of produce with value.
always prepare the field well it's a basic thing to grow without preparing your field well you can't harvest quality products.
also there are special steps which a person must follow in order to have quality product.
1. cleaning the field.
this is the very first step, you are needed to gather all the waste and crop residues and dumb it in the field so as to prepare for a nutrient fertilizer.
once in a while you can collect garbage and burn them whenever it's needed but because burning kills friendly pests.
2. farming.
this can work using a hand hoe, a tractor and a plow drawn by a cow.
cultivation helps the fertilizer to mix well, good root penetration, good air penetration in the ground as well as water.
you are required to dig 10-15cm and also it will help in weeds not to sprout early.
3. making canals.
here you have to make solid barriers to help the water not to penetrate out of the canal and the barriers should be long enough to ensure enough water is stored inside the canal.
4. mixing up.
in mixing up you should put 3-5 cm of water above sea level and then stir it to enable the water and soil to be well mixed.
this can be done with a hand hoe, a tractor, and also a plow drawn by a cow.
5. leveling the farm
after mixing up you need to level so that the soil can have the same level and this can be done using a rake.
this helps in planting too for reasons it grows in one shape.
6. transplantation of rice.
to obtain a lot of yield and to make rice farming beneficial, it is important for farmers to focus on this important approach and to abandon arbitrary cultivation by directing seed directly into the field.
in addition, farmers who follow this principles have achieved great success.
profits that are found from transplanting rice.
the farmer is usually able to choose the best and good seedling while they're in the nursery.
the seedlings grow quickly and healthier.
small amount of seeds is required.
the harvest becomes much.
methods of transplanting rice.
transplanting in rows.
transplanting without following rows (anyhow).
transplanting in rows is the best method because it facilitates in weeding and harvesting and you will get good returns because you planted in measurements.
preparations for transplanting seedlings.
prior to transplanting seedlings in the field it is important to make the following preparations:
watering the seedlings to make it easy to uproot them.
in order to prevent the seedlings from breaking, the seedlings should be uprooted by holding them from bottom of the stem.
avoid uprooting several seedlings at the same time.
seedlings should be packaged into small portions so as to facilitate transportation and transplanting in the field
select good seedlings only.
characteristics of good seedlings
they should be of the same length
they should have short and turgid leaves, many and healthy roots not damaged by pests or diseases.
how to transplant seedlings.
seedlings should be held with three fingers as shown in the picture below.
transplant between 2 -3 seedlings per hole.
for better results, the seedlings should be transplanted in the depth of 2-3 cm.
I hope you have learned and known more about rice farming let us meet again next time.

Member of Parliament cries to the government over farmers' security
Member of Parliament for Laikipia Jane Machira yesterday urged the government to take emergency actions to stop the rising theft of livestock in Kinamba and Ol Moran areas.
speaking after visiting those areas, she said that the campaign to retrieve illegal weapons in Baringo and Turkana County cannot succeed if the pastoralist community residing in Laikipia are left with the weapons.
"attacks have increased and I do not understand why cattle are stolen in Laikipia and taken to Baringo through Mchongoi and in one private store.
chiefs in those areas where cattle are taken must be warned or lose their jobs for failing to inform the government of these bandits," she said.
the Member of Parliament said it is a saddening thing to watch citizens dying and being hurt badly and their cattle stolen by poachers as security guards appearing to fail.
Missus Machira said that a perfect action is a must to be taken to get rid of all illegal weapons since the time has reached to save these areas from bandits whose aim is to steal and kill.
the Member of Parliament added that farmers also must be protected from these bandits and she said she is ready to involve herself with the plans of conducting a dialogue between elders from all communities residing in the boundary between Baringo and Laikipia.
currently, the government is conducting a twenty-four-hour campaign to eradicate the ownership of illegal weapons in Baringo area.
Missus Machira said the continuing attacks are showing that the operation retrieve weapons cannot succeed if Laikipia will be left behind in the campaign.

Sumaye reminds of Mkapa
June 04, 2015
former prime minister, Frederick Sumaya has said all the ministers who were in the council of ministers of the third phase government are responsible for all the decisions made then.
Raia Mwema has been told that in its meeting with the media that was arranged to take place in Dar es Salaam yesterday, Sumaye shall explain that there is no minister who can refuse to be part of the decision when he did not resign his position then.
some of confusing decisions of the third phase government were selling of state houses to servants, buying a plane for the president and a radar to guide the plane which all arose a discussion that time.
"everything that sparked discussions while I was the prime minister were done in agreement inside the council of ministers.
no minister can say he did not hear.
"I will be surprised if there is anyone who will come to say he did not participate in the decisions made when he was in the council that decided and he did not resign to disagree," said Sumaye.
Sumaye was expected to talk to the media yesterday to announce his aim of running for presidency in Tanzania through CCM.
for a period of ten years of president Benjamin Mkapa's reign, Sumaye was the prime minister and till now, he is the one with a history of holding that position for the longest time than all the others since Tanzania became independent.
because he was the succeeding minister, some of his political opponents can decide to bring down more blame on him and his explanations have an aim of answering those kinds of beatings that will emerge.
together with those challenges, Sumaye will also use that opportunity to explain his success he found at that time that gives him more qualifications of succeeding president Jakaya Kikwete than his opponents.
some of the qualities are knowing the country and its needs well, the ability to raise the economy, integrity and experience in leadership.
China discovers a rock of minerals in the moon.
by Leonard Onyango.
the Chinese Sky Research Institute has found proof about the presence of a huge rock made of minerals in the moon.
that discovery published in the Nature Communications newspaper was revealed after an equipment known as Chang'e 3 sent photos showing the rock.
"the photos received from the Chang'e 3 equipment show a huge rock that is in a dark area," said the researcher of planet issues from China University, Zongcheng Ling.
the equipment of Chang'e 3 has been in the moon since it arrived in the year 2013.
already China has released another equipment known as Chang'e 4 that is expected to land on the moon in the year 2018.
previously, the Chang'e 4 equipment was programmed to arrive on the moon in the year 2020 but Zongcheng says that it will arrive two years earlier, different to how it was thought.
"despite the moon being close to the earth where we live, there are still many things that we do not understand," says Zongcheng.
in the recent years, China has been seen putting emphasis on research of the moon while America focuses on the distant planets like Mars and Pluto.
that discovery agrees with previous researches which hint on the presence of rocks in the moon.
researchers said that the rock is found at an area which is believed to have been a huge pool of water.
according to those researchers, that pool is the one that appears like a person standing when you look at the moon.
how the moon reduces the rain: new research has shown that when the moon is up in the sky at night, its weight can reduce the amount of rain on earth.
the results published in the Geophysical Research Letters magazine by researchers from Washington University, America show that, when the moon is up (illuminating the crown), its weight reduces the amount of humidity in the surrounding air.
researchers Tsubasa Kohyama and John Wallace who did that research say that the reduction of the humidity reduces the amount that rains.
the researchers made that report after analyzing data and the rain trends collected by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of America and the Japanese one (JAEA) between the year 1998 and 2012.
Kohyama and Wallace clarified that the weight of the moon when up reduces the amount of rain by one percent.
"what we understand is that this is the first research involving the moon's pressure and the rain,"
said Tsubasa Kohyama, a postgraduate student in the science of climatic issues.
however, those researchers say that the condition changes from time to time.
"even though there are no effects on agriculture, this discovery is important in helping scientists conduct more research related to the behavior of climate conditions," said Kohyama.
in the year 1847, scientists discovered that the moon's rotations affects the obstruction of air in the sky.
in the year 1932, researchers revealed that the obstruction of air affects heat in the air too.
in the year 2014, researchers from Washington University confirmed that the pressure on earth changes according to the moon's rotation.
researchers now say that they are targeting to study if the moon's rotations contribute to rains accompanied by thunderstorms.
this mom will kill me, every time she wants something she escapes her husband and call me to a hotel to take care of her
this mom in the picture wants to kill me just a little boy, I met her in Mlimani City at The Game she was doing shopping with her little children the things she had bought were many so I helped her take them to her car, thanked me and asked for my phone number, from there on we were communicating but as the days went by we found ourselves chatting about love and one day we met and gave her 3 doses of power, it is now getting worse because every week she looks for me twice I give her things she says that her husband cannot do, she always pays the hotel with everything till the drinks I work my doses, I have tried to investigate her and realized she is a famous politician's wife here in Tanzania.
I am worried by fearing for my life while still young and I am looking for life.
I ask for advice...
the importance of taboos in the African society.
the greatest strength of taboos and beliefs in the African societies was to direct and control the behavior and conduct of people.
the relations between in-laws were directed by certain taboos and ideologies.
the major intention of the taboos and ideologies was to maintain respect, a good approach among in-laws from both two sides and promote good morality.
it is not my aim in this article to try and take you back to the stone age so as to continue holding onto the culture and beliefs especially those that are obsolete, no never.
in its place, I intend to show how the Swahili literature is full of wealth which wouldn't fit in a stack of books which dealt with oral literature in depth.
additionally, despite deviation which is a fruit of the foreign tradition, the society can borrow from some of the items of the past as one way of dealing with some of conflicts which face the marriage institution every daybreak.
according to the Kamba, it was a taboo for the daughter-in-law to bend with their back, chest or the waist pointing towards the father-in-law.
this was viewed as lack of respect.
therefore then, it was very important for that daughter-in-law to know where the father-in-law usually sat so as to keep a distance from him during the time of executing roles that required her to bend or twist like washing dishes, pounding cereals, winnowing cereals and serving food among others. by Enock Nyariki.
furthermore, in that same community, a daughter-in-law was supposed to be covered well when the father-in-law was at home.
wearing a long dress alone wasn't enough if a wrap cloth was not tied around the waist and maybe a scarf to cover the chest areas.
it was an important thing for a Kamba man who intends to marry to inform his fiancée of how she was required to dress the day her fiancé's family visits her parents so as to avoid their relationship from breaking up prematurely by being viewed as disrespectful to her in-laws to be.
according to the tradition of the Kisii, Kamba, Luo and other many African tribes, it was a taboo for the daughter-in-law to go into the bedroom of her husbands parents or a father or mother to enter into their married son's bedroom, regardless of the number of rooms the house had.
that tradition has been held onto tightly by some clans in that, when parents visit their children in the city, a house should be rented for them even if those children have a sea of houses.
the parents to the husband or wife would never accept to use the same bathroom that their children used to bath.
according to the Kamba community, if it was a must for the daughter-in-law to go into the bedroom, maybe if the mother or father-in-law was in critically sick, then she was forced to leave money or a certain gift by the door before going into the bedroom so as to show that she had 'bought' that room.
not going into the bedroom was a way of promoting respect between the daughter-in-law and her husband's parents.
among many communities living in Nyanza, Western and Eastern areas of Kenya and in the Rift Valley it was a taboo for the husband to greet the wife's mother or the wife to greet the father-in-law by hand.
apart from that, it was a taboo in many African communities for in-laws to use the bedding or covering materials of their children's wives.
those things are together with blankets, sheets or even mattresses which their children had already used.
arguments or quarrels of any kind by daughters-in-law with their in-laws was prohibited in approximately all African communities.
it was not allowed for children to retort to their in-laws no matter how hated they were.
however, the aping of the western culture has eroded and even swallowed up some of those taboos and ideologies.

some of these cyclists from Kenya, Uganda and South Africa have already begun to arrive here to participate in the tournament as well as members from the local regions, including Tanga, Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Manyara and the host Arusha.
the coordinator of the Arusha Cycling Club (ACC), Mosses Andrew said yesterday the competition will be about 65 kilometers on the first day and the second day 52 kilometers.
"to this end, preparations for the race are going well and this time we have got external participants, we have Faith the race to be competitive as some regions we have sent invitations will come and how much this response has been for this year different from last year," said Andrew.
he appealed to the Government to allocate special features for the development of the game in the country from the regional level because without doing so the game is in danger of being lost with many stakeholders who love the game.
the competition has been organized by ACC, which is held annually this being the second year since its launch, aimed at developing and upgrading the game's new talents.
various prizes will be provided including cash money where the first winner will receive Sh 200,000, second win Sh 150,000, third 110,000, fourth 70,000 and fifth 50,000.
leaders are ordered to look for those without toilets.
written by Lucas Raphael, Igunga.
published: 28th November 2016.
the local government of Igunga District, Tabora Region has given one week to the heads of villages and wards to arrest people who will be found without toilets in their residential areas.
the statement was issued by the acting administrative secretary of the district who is also an officer, Shadrack Kalekayo on behalf of Ivunga District Commissioner, John Mwaipopo while addressing the public at a public meeting held in Ziba Ward in the district.
the acting administrative secretary said every household is needed to focus on the whole issue of health including having good toilets and also maintaining washing hands the moment they are from the toilet to prevent infectious diseases.
however, he said in addition to the government providing education for its citizens about having toilets, there are some of the citizens who continue to ignore government directives and said such people should be arrested and taken to court.
"village and ward officials, I ask you to listen carefully and am giving seven days to ensure that you arrest all those who defied digging toilets and take them to court," said Calice.
Igunga District health officer, John Masesa said when environments are polluted it causes contagious diseases including tuberculosis, diarrhea, cholera, malaria, paralysis, polio and worms, where he said that 80 percent of these diseases are due to environmental pollution.
Repoa research to launch a government
written by Shadrack Sagati
published: 05 December 2016
among the areas where Tanzanians believe that they have not benefited appropriately with their resources is in the mineral sector, as a result of that resource being mined by foreign companies.
what we Tanzanians get from that resource is employment while the government is benefiting from various taxes and royalties.
since the mining companies began investing in the country, their reports on taxes have not been transparent, something that makes Tanzanians believe that there is fraud done by these companies so as not to pay the required taxes.
an example is the auditor's report of the mining companies in the country of the year 2015 that confirmed failure to pay 521.6 billion shillings in tax as a result of a fraudulent environment in the payment and registration processes.
but also the Minerals Agency (TMAA) confirmed the existence of 10.3 billion shillings that had not been paid in royalties and service tax amounting to 2.5 billion shillings.
this controversy has been there for a long time and it rises from our weak mineral laws that do not provide the government an opportunity to become part of the investment.
instead we have remained spectators when the resource is being harvested in plenty by other foreign companies.
I agree with the research done recently by the Institute of Research on Poverty Alleviation (REPOA) that has warned Tanzania of failing to benefit from the gas and oil resources if it won't set laws that mandates the government to be a stakeholder of the company that comes out to mine that resource as in Botswana.
in that research, Repoa openly showed that despite the minerals law requiring Tanzanians to be involved, it is open that there is a difference between to be given ownership and being involved.
that means, if we could be part of the ownership of the mines, we have an opportunity to get to the point of production, but by only being involved, we don't have the authority to know the amount that those mines produce.
I believe that if the government could be part of the ownership of the mines, the investors cannot cheat on payment of taxes because the Tanzanians could have the opportunity of accessing the kitchen where there is the production of those minerals.
we will not wait to be told we have produced a certain amount, but we witness and see for ourselves, however it's only involvement, you can be told a lie or the investors can lament that the registration fee in enormous, hence charged little tax, something that has made Tanzania not to benefit from minerals.
REPOA has given an example of Botswana and how it benefits from diamond minerals.
in research done by Abel Kinyondo, it is explained that they started exploitation of diamond minerals in the year 1967 and its residents have benefited from the existence of that resource.
that is from the year 1969, when the government began owning 15 percent with foreign investors allowed 75 percent of the company that was given the contract to mine the De Beers minerals.
Botswana is among the leading diamond traders in the world, but the revenues obtained from those minerals are closely monitored by the government of that country, as a result of having a system of ownership of the mines in collaboration with the investors.
by now, Botswana has the same proportion of ownership of the company with the investors that is, the government owns 50 percent while the investors also own 50 percent, something that Repoa builds it gives the government an opportunity to follow-up from the exploitation to processing of the minerals.
I personally support Repoa's research that, in order to benefit more appropriately from our resources, it is important to ape this example by Botswana especially as we head towards gas and oil economy.
if we don't do that, I believe these resources will turn to a curse.
we have been witnesses of how oil resources brought war in Nigeria as a result of the Niger Delta area that produces oil in plenty, residents of those areas remain poor while that oil wealth benefiting a few people.
our capital is land and those resources, while their capital is money.
let them come we partner so that we too can get to the kitchen and see the realities of the income and the amount of gas and oil that we are producing.

electronic tickets to start from Simba, Yanga.
written by Basil.
published: 18th September 2016.
electronic tickets will start to work officially, during the match of soccer rivals in the country Simba and Yanga, in October first this year.
while talking in his office in Dar es Salaam yesterday, Minister of Information, Culture, Art and Sports, Nape Nnauye said that the tickets will be tested on the September 25th game involving Simba and Yanga.
"there are friendly matches to contribute to the earthquake victims in Kagera region, it will involve Bongo Movie and Bongo Fleva, members of parliament for Simba and Yanga and we shall test the electronic tickets for the first time in those games.
everything is ready and after those temptations, since the Simba and Yanga competition those tickets will start being used officially to help seal loopholes, (revenue thieves) entry revenues have been stolen for a very long time," stressed Nape.
the Sunday of September 11, 2016, Minister Nape, officially launched the use of those tickets in the National Stadium.
the system is a directive of the Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa concerning revenue controls at the entrances whereby it is a system that will require a fan to have a card like ATM ones, that will enable him to make purchases/payments while also having the ability to buy tickets for matches that he likes through the same card.
among those given the cards to the stadium's entrance are Minister Nape, President John Magufuli and his vice president Samia Suluhu Hassan as a mobilization where the smart card will be released free of charge to the fans and after that he will begin to enter the stadium after depositing money in it.
another benefit of the system is that there will no longer be a mechanism to divide revenue manually to the relevant institution, instead, if you want a ticket, the sharing percentage will be done more technologically to TFF, TRA, BMT and other relevant parts.
why does the government be defeated to start the sports organization?
managing the sports it's a big cost even the government of the Nations that continues does not guarantee the one by one sports because of understanding the issue of costs.
in developed countries, their governments don't manage sports directly but they have created special organizations because of the management of those sports in their countries, and they have made sure those organizations give good management to the national teams.
for example, the United Kingdom has created a UK Sports company for managing sports especially in national teams, and the company looks for funds and distributes them into projects to develop various national teams.
here in the country, still we are looking up to the government to release money in their budget every year for the purpose of conducting sports in the country, a way that our government of Tanzania has not been doing.
the main reason that the government is budgeting is not enough to give priority to sports because most of the budget funds are invested in education, health, infrastructure, debt, and other sectors due to its importance in government plans and needs of the people.
such that, every year when the government announce the budget, the players got themselves suffering a lot because sports sector is given few shares of money which does not help sports at all.
I understand our government is lead by Sports Federation in the Country (BMT) in the area of sports which is given priority of supervising sports under Ministry for Communication, youths, art and sports, such that I prefer BMT to be changed and to be a sport federation which will work with government and non-government so as to bring improvement at sports sector in the country.
the agency should be independent as other organization, governmental, but to seek various sponsors and stakeholders who can contribute financially or organize fundraising.
also that federation has to follow sports organization, to follow the government and move on worldwide to search for different source of income then they collet.
that organization has the capacity to tell the sports' association to give them a national team, what kind of coaches they want, and these coaches will be paid salaries with that sports' organization but if they truly have responsible leaders.
I believe that way will help in good management of income and usage, but the way the situation is right now the sports' association have been left with a bigger responsibility of promoting sports in the country and even though, it does not mean that the associations should be anxious in their area.
if the government will accept my view towards the establishment of a sports organization in the country then sports parties to have the responsibility of planning their own budget and submit it to the association as well as their recommendations and the organization will have the responsibility to fund the sports club and provide them with the conditions that will help the sports organization have the right to question the use of such funds for sports clubs and sports clubs also will be obliged to provide information on their expenditure to the organization.
because it is a government agency, then the sports association, the government, and audit firm will join and audit the revenue and expenditure of sports clubs and manage well the sports club.
it is clear in that procedure people leading sports clubs will work by 90 percent if not 100 because currently, the work efficiency of sports club leaders isn't even 20 percent while money awarded to the sports clubs by sponsors have been disappearing into the pockets of leaders and whatever was expected has never been achieved.

fear of successful women and the notion of the family head.
I got an opportunity of participating in one debate on Facebook today.
the debate itself was commenced by Samuel Sasali, who in my opinion has a significant ability to provoke topics that concern our daily lives.
the argument that was on the table was brought in a way that show the difficulties a woman goes through when she succeeds educationally.
that as a woman climbs the educational ladder, in like manner men run away from her.
who is to blame men or women?
there is the truth that in our community, highly educated women have a very difficult time getting lasting relationships, with people they expect again for a time.
and even if they get most of us agree that many of those relationships face storms here and there and sometimes those relationships get broken.
men claim they fear these women because together with beauty and smartness of brain and body, it is said that they lack the respect required for marriage.
when they get education, it's claimed they aren't ready to submit to a man.
that's men's major fear that prevents them from starting and maintaining relationships with successful women be it educationally or economically.
if you look properly you will see that there is some truth that successful women sometimes fail to submit to a man.
when they succeed, they begin to feel that, they have a right to be equal to men in all areas of life.
this state isn't accepted by many men who need to see themselves as the real head of the family by being listened to, accepted and given respect even if they don't fulfill his responsibility.
these are the facts translated by men to mean humility.
even so, this opinion has many problems.
for example, it's not every time successful women are the problem.
there are women who have no success but still threaten men.
yes, these sometimes are just feelings that if believed turn out to be true.
and if you truly investigate carefully a lot of relationship misunderstandings, you'll discover that the main problem is self-mistrust that men have and not how they are.
it is true that many men have problems relating to themselves a condition we can call poverty of self, that makes them unable to relate with women unconditionally and at times burden women unfairly.
one example they have is this we are talking about of being threatened by the success of women.
it is this fear of a woman's success that makes many men seek for relationships with uneducated women and who are dependent so that they can rule and control them.
they use the notion of the family head contrary to reality.
I beg now to show shortly how it is that the problem can't be a woman's success, rather it is a man's weakness that makes them afraid of women's success.
head of the family
let's start with the notion of the family head that men love so much.
being the head of the family doesn't mean brutality or dictatorship or the ability to control a woman rather it's the ability to be an example of the things that are supposed to happen in the family, the ability to show the way and establish the perfect environment for family members to communicate well with themselves and in that manner relate well among themselves.
by being recognized as the family head, it's the man who is supposed to be the first person to have good self relations himself.
he is not supposed to be a person who has troubled relations with self and is struggling to seek the peace that comes from outside.
that is the same as saying a man who doesn't trust himself or others, a man worried with his own self, a man seeking happiness at the cost of others, will end up starting relationships as an effort to hide his flaws by wrongly using the notion of being the head of the family.
usually, this type of man thinks that being the head of the family means having more money, more education, more intellect, being older et cetera so that he can use all of them as arms against a woman's threat.
now someone is asking themselves, how is it that a man who is the head of the family uses education, money, status, experience and all manner of tactics to control a woman.
is this not weakness?
down here I'll try we examine five attributes of a man with a poor relationship with his space, attributes that make him unable to be ready to pay the cost of being the real head of the family and therefore find himself running away from women who are self-aware.
1) he doesn't like to be corrected but he is a good corrector
a man of this kind knows he has a certain weakness which he doesn't like others to know.
because of that he doesn't like to be corrected because the language of correcting him sends a message that emphasizes castration feelings of self which he already has.
his comfort is seeing others corrected and for that, he supports digging in and making others feel bad.
he can't feel good in praising others.
he is threatened by the happiness of others.
even so, we aren't saying that someone won't sit he corrects.
but when it becomes a character, that you must correct everyone when you don't have a solution, we ourselves ask about the health of your soul.
2) he is threatened by the success of others, competes without any reason.
he doesn't like to see others become greater than him.
he is someone who clashes with people he believes are threatening his honor.
at times he competes even in small things that you never imagined need competition.
the objective is to boast that even he is able.
it is true, a human being by nature is a competitor but not to the level of building a wall against people who genuinely are not a threat and at times don't have anything to do with you.
3) if the talker/open person succeeds, if the secretive person isn't successful.
these are the kinds of men who when you are with them, it's like they want you to be a listener to their boasting.
this type of man lives a life of talking/saying.
and most of what he says concern himself, "I was, I am, I will, I won't".
it's true we love success but not to the level of desiring to get a television program to say how successful we are.
even so, it's not every time a man of means is open.
when things go in an unexpected way, he becomes secretive.
and sometimes he uses lies in order to hide the disgrace of being seen as having not reached where he wants or pretends he was brought down by others.
4) he doesn't accept his mistakes, he's vengeful to people who wronged him.
if you have a male friend who when he's in the wrong isn't quick to accept mistakes, and again at times you're forced to confess things you know very well aren't your mistakes then that's the man we're talking about here.
when you make a mistake, he's quick to blame and to recall past mistakes.
these are the people who can sulk for a whole week like an effort to avoid taking responsibility and accepting the truth.
are vengeful and sometimes they have grudges with people.
5) he has a romantic jealousy, he is scornful
self-mistrust makes him a suspicious person who feels the presence of a third person who is spying on his relationship even when he himself isn't faithful.
it's the opinion of self-mistrust that makes him quick in distrusting a person.
and sometimes he gets into love relations with many people to look for fake comfort.
now in order to deal with his self-mistrust, sometimes he is someone who likes to identify with people whose status he seeks himself.
famous people.
you can find that out if you are near him because he doesn't hesitate to ridicule people he feels have no status like the one he seeks.
costs of relating with this man
I haven't gone through all explanations with the objective of shortening the article.
in short, this state of mistrust which comes from the bad relationships with his soul, are usually the results of upbringing and life experiences which build perspectives, trust, and behavior that doesn't emphasize true relations with the soul.
to satisfy this kind of a man, who is struggling to relate with his own soul can't be an easy job.
and in truth, a woman who lives with this person has a big role of paying the cost of making him feel good in many ways.
firstly, the woman will be obliged not to have better credentials than her husband.
she shouldn't be educated, shouldn't have money, shouldn't be famous, she shouldn't have a job that's better than her husband's et cetera.
it's like we saw that this man interprets, other people's success as being his own failure this together with people close to him.
and this is the reason many end up in relationships with women whose success doesn't surpass theirs.
that's why you can be surprised a person has a PhD, has met how many women who aren't deserving in his journey of education so much so that he ends up marrying an illiterate woman.
another, if you'll be better than him, understand you'll be compelled to ensure that it isn't seen.
you'll be required to put in the effort that makes him recognize that he's successful, knowledgeable, he is able all the days constantly.
in another language don't be restless or show that you have certain skills in you.
this isn't an easy job and it demands the cost of self-denial and your status because we know, human beings rejoice in success.
this is to say, it will require you as "a real" woman to avoid an environment of correcting him.
even when you feel he's making a mistake, you'll be forced to let him continue with his mistake even when you know it will affect both of you.
the objective is to remove the likelihood of making him feel despised.
if you must advise, then let the language make him feel those are his views and they have been built on his mind.
at the same time, his feelings of envy will force you to give him an opportunity of understanding you well so that he can trust you and reduce the worry of being cheated or dumped.
here we aren't saying a man who trusts himself doesn't need openness in his wife's life, but this openness goes beyond limits so much so that if he was able, he yearns to follow you using a CCTV in order to know where you are and what you're doing and with whom and what minute.
and because we have seen that he is someone to whom forgiveness is heavy and is a vengeful person, that means as "a real woman" you'll have to take responsibility of carrying the cross of blame whenever there are relationship differences.
is it right for a woman to bear the burden?
as we saw, this certainly isn't a light burden to a normal woman who enters into a relationship with the expectation of getting fulfillment and the love of her husband.
remember, in a relationship, it's the man's responsibility to bear the "burden" of responsibility in order to establish an environment that makes a woman feel like a queen.
this is what being the head really means in the leadership of a relationship.
nevertheless, in a normal situation, this leadership can't work in an environment where the husband himself who is supposed to bear that burden is the same we are discussing here.
before I finish, let me say directly that before you start a relationship with a man with the character we saw here, it would be good to get professional help to help him change first.
otherwise, you'll find yourself bearing a burden with the heaviness of a cross.
the challenge though is that even when he's advised to see a behavioral professional, he interprets your advice as ridicule and distrust of his ability.
that surprises me because, he believes he knows even when he doesn't and any attempt to lead him to the knowledge that he needs, he will interpret as being despised.
in conclusion, we can say that a stable man, a man who relates well to his soul, a man who is self-conscious and understands his responsibility, isn't threatened by a woman's stability or success.
when he becomes stable, a man is usually able to pay the cost of relating. with any woman without caring about that woman's success.
if it is that way there won't be a problem of understanding that the only right weapon for "ruling over" any woman if it's together with the successful one is to love her with diligence and to create for her an environment in which she feels valued more than anything else.
it's only very few women who can fight against this weapon.
even in that way, that doesn't mean that a woman won't need to pay the cost.
no of course not.
the woman likewise needs to ensure that she's self-aware, she relates well to her soul and in that way recognize her role in the relationship without caring about success or how she's better than her husband.
otherwise, it's true, as she succeeds in like manner she's creating for herself an environment of loneliness.

Zitto threatens to skip Kigoma sessions
it's written by Fadhili Abdallah, Kigoma.
published: 5th September 2016.
the member of parliament for Kigoma Urban, Zitto has announced his intention to skip the sessions of the Kigoma Municipal Council, which are used to submit various Ward reports if the regulations and procedures for the proceedings of the sessions will not be corrected.
Zitto said in the present situation, such sessions are not productive instead, they have been like coffee and pigeon pea stones.
speaking before the closing of the session of the councilors council of the municipality, Zitto wanted to know the quarterly implementation reports of the previous session to see if the challenges and problems the councilors presented at the session had been implemented.
responding to that, the mayor of Kigoma City Municipality, Hussein Ruhava, said in accordance with the regulations, such sessions set by the ministry in the office of the president, regional administration and local government (Tamisemi) are for the purpose of submitting Ward reports and if there are things that should be implemented, they are forwarded to the standing committee of the council where they are debated.
following the answer, Zitto said he would not attend the sessions because they are not responsible in accountability.
he told the municipal director that, it is prohibited to invite him to a councilors' meeting for submitting ward reports.
the director of Kigoma Urban Municipality, Judethadeus Mboya said that the argument of the member of parliament was logical and that although the principle does not say so, they would strive to have a summary of the report on what transpired so as to explain the implementation of what was done.
young man fined a he goat by elders
residents here were left gaping when Jombi was fined a he goat by the council of elders for having an intimate affair with his neighbor's wife.
the man was caught relaxing with someone's wife at three o'clock in the afternoon.
according to the source, the woman had lied to her husband that she was at the salon having her hair made.
rumors say that, instead of going to the salon she sneaked into the young man's room who is their neighbor.
"the woman after confirming no one had seen her, entered the young man's room who is their neighbor and they begun their antics," said the source.
however, she was not lucky because one woman saw her entering the young man's room and when they locked themselves inside, she looked for the husband and told him what was going on.
it is said that when the husband got the news that his wife was sharing the fruit, he decided to sneak up on them.
when he knocked on the door several times and it wasn't opened, he decided to break down the door with all his strength and entered inside.
"the man did not believe his eyes when he found the mother of his children with the young man half naked trying to get dressed."
he screamed and a crowd of people crowded the place.
"attempts by the young man to flee through the window failed and he was nabbed," said the source.
it is said that some of the residents started beating him up but he was saved by the village elder assisted by head of community policing.
an emergency meeting was organized whereby the husband of the woman forgave them but the elders fined the young man a he goat.
however, the woman fled in fear of her husband just as soon as the elders session was concluded.
up to the time of writing this news, it is not known where she went.
the husband refused to take the he goat that the young man had paid as fine, saying that he had already forgiven him and the elders sold it and shared the money.

"there is no relationship of a parent's education with the quality of upbringing"- researchers
the concept is that the high level of education that a parent possesses implies the quality and effectiveness of the upbringing.
in western countries, for example, the quality of upbringing in the sense of understanding of the child's psychological needs has been linked to parental education that goes along with the accountability of the upbringing.
the situation seems to be different in Sub-Saharan countries.
surveys conducted at different times in Tanzania, Botswana, Nigeria and Lesotho indicate that there is no direct relationship between education, income or parental success and the quality of their children's upbringing.
instead, in an astonishing manner, non-educated parents and with non-dignified work are more likely to be more responsible than their colleagues who have learned from the Degree onwards.
in addition, these surveys show when Highly educated parents do not find/do not have time to stay and communicate with their children accordingly, still at least striving to create a home-based environment in the form of books, television, and other sports facilities for children.
on the other hand, non-educated parents or dignified work, have seemed to have a relationship with the children, spending more time teaching children the most acceptable behavior in their communities.
however, these parents have found it difficult to create a friendly home learning environment for their home as their well-educated colleagues.
home environment
almost all researchers I mentioned at the end of this article agree that without regard to education or parental income, home environment and parental attitudes are mainly affecting the childhood growth and upbringing of children.
while home environment refers to the atmosphere of love shown by parents to children, parental relationships, parental dynamics, time spent by parents at home and access to learning materials;
parental attitudes, on the other hand, are parents' expectations for their children, efforts to understand and respond to the emotional needs of the child, how to encourage and even punish children.
however, the findings of such surveys show that most African parents start caring for, monitoring, redirecting and interfering with their children's activities when they reach adulthood.
the main reason mentioned is that during this period children begin to show behaviors that are not pleasing to parents, which are primarily a result of neglected emotional needs from the past.
before then, parents regardless of education believe that there is no great need for force in creating a child's behavior.
the meaning of these results to parents
in Africa, classroom education does not help a person to be a good parent or not even do not make the parent fulfill his role.
what is apparent is that the level of education goes hand in hand with the increase in other responsibilities that parents find themselves paying more attention than upbringing.
on the other hand, the lack of these responsibilities becomes beneficial to the child though the challenge remains accurate understanding of the needs of the child.
obviously, the social and economic changes we witness in our countries, bring new challenges to the upbringing.
when an educated parent is struggling to give up his time to deal with these challenges outside the family, a non-educated parent is also coping with these challenges at home in his own way.
in one way or another, the kind of work we do as parents, our attitudes and other challenges affects how we deal with the emotion of the child.
it may be time for us as parents and caregivers to develop a culture to understand the important steps of child growth in order to identify the needs and problems of children since the baby is born.
research team and researchers?
a lot of research has been done on the needs and problems of children in the continent of Africa.
why do these surveys not reach targeted people?
one major reason is that many surveys focus on promoting professional knowledge alone.
it is done for the sake of researchers to communicate with them and not directly apply to solving real problems.
that is why many results end up decorating cabinets for libraries of educational institutions irrespective of the public.
together with many challenges, this blog aims at being a connection between those libraries and parents.
for several weeks we will review the psychological needs of various childhood ages from birth to 20 years
for the following division: 0 to 3, 3 - 6, 6 - 12 and 12 years
- 20.
the goal is not to direct or advise anyone what to do but to try to spread the information that is available but does not reach where it should.
this article has been developed with the help of texts, theses, and books of the following researchers:
A. Blair, I.
Omari, T. Mwamwenda, D. Mbilinyi, A. Mbise, A. Oyewole and C. Nyinamuntu
who all have statements in the education and development of the child.

very heavy flow during menstruation (female),
rushing into other people's businesses (a habit of involving yourself in matters that do not concern you),
headaches,
having a stiff back (male),
easy infection by the love jinn,
lose of efficiency in work,
quite easy contraction of HIV in case of unprotected intercourse with an infected person,
you can develop a new habit you never had before to be an alternative
like drunkenness etc.
let's not hate prostitutes beyond measure -2
I like prostitutes because they are our fellow societal members but I don't defend prostitution acts.
it is good for us to know what our ladies are encountering when they toss themselves into the unofficial and dangerous business to their lives and let me say to even their customers or participants.
it is not all prostitutes who are found in just bar areas, but 'Jam N Jea' that I talked of last week, bo is the most surprising one and they are even so many in Dodoma.
they do not go to the parliament areas but it is not a secret that the ladies have moved to Dodoma.
they are targeting some of the parliamentarians who are not faithful in their marriages and their personalities.
also, it is some of those national leaders who shout at the prostitution behavior.
there are some employees in offices who have a habit of involving themselves in love affairs with their fellow employees or bosses and even with some of the clients who go there with business intention.
it shames the girls to cheapen themselves that much so as to succeed in work.
that is also prostitution and there are others whom you can't absolutely suspect.
they are women with a respectful appearance.
these who commit 'prostitution' in their offices from my experience, I have also seen that when they get married, some of them have been truants to their husbands.
that situation oppresses their husbands who thought that, by marrying them they will quieten down instead they are secretly 'heartless'.
criminals!
their encounters are a lot shocking. I was lucky to meet one lady in the morning near the police station clinging to one man who had given her a lift in his car that morning, taking her to police station for refusing to alight demanding to be paid on claims of having made love with him which was not true.
when I asked her she said, "I didn't succeed in getting a client all night long, and when this old man gave me a lift I was forced to change the story that he made love to me and doesn't want to pay me".
this is shameful and the trouble of addictive prostitution.
there is a college going lady from the province who goes to permitted night club bars in the evening for prostitution so as to get money to sustain herself in life.
another one says, she has a sugar daddy or an old lover and even though she is in college, she is forced to sell her body as a result of the need for income.
she also says that she doesn't care if that old man has a wife or children, what she cares about is that old man's money. she complains that she doesn't get the college loan but it is instead available to the children of the mighty in government.
corruption.
it is shocking, I found a young lady in the middle of the night along Mandela road areas walking bare feet in a torn blouse saying.
she had been abandoned there by a man who wanted to make love to her without a condom without paying her anything.
the trouble of prostitution.
this one has a firm stand in safeguarding her life for she said.
no without a condom.
there's a lady who has one year old twins who got into prostitution after being dumped by the man who impregnated her and her financially unable parents chased her away from home.
many prostitutes suffer when they are sick and unable to work.
this situation is caused especially as a result of the wavering national economy, low-quality education, a poor past life of the citizens and the growing corruption in our government leaders.
lack of basic needs for a family.
experience hooker, is a name given to the women who are well versed in this prostitution business without exposing themselves. some of them have rented respectable houses.
they usually trap younger guys and even those with certain office positions or businessmen with the aim of living with them in their houses.
the guys especially music artistes referred to as 'Mario' as sung by the late Franco Lwanzo Makiadi.
those hookers feel happy and proud when they go for an outing in the evening with these young guys looking well dressed.
there are also hookers who live through this prostitution business for many years, they instead do not live with even one man, but they alternate several men without their knowledge where each one is given a financial role for her expenses and whoever fails is thrown out of the arena and dumped.
the legalization of prostitution, there are some developed countries where the prostitution business is legalized by having special 'buildings' where girls are bred.
the owners of this business are registered, pay taxes and medical insurance for the girls, and they have official contracts.
those building are called wore houses.
my advice, ladies abandon that business 'illegal and dangerous'.
leaders and concerned women ministry, put efforts to save our youths instead of running to mete out severe punishment that do not have proper motivation.
think about it.
Makete claims, pyrethrum buyers buy at night to avoid paying tax to the committee
Rashid Mkwinda
Makete district committee Njombe province has claimed that pyrethrum crop buyers have been avoiding paying tax by buying that crop at night and escaping without paying tax to that committee.
this has been pointed out by the deputy chairman of Makete district committee Jison Mbalizi when he was contributing to a debate at a meeting of pyrethrum crop stakeholders at the Mid town hall in Makambako town last weekend.
"buyers enter Makete secretly at night and buy pyrethrum without paying tax to the committee, that is theft, we are asking that measures be taken against those companies," said Mbalizi.
he said that the committee hasn't been paid tax for more than six months while companies continue buying pyrethrum he has that there is need to control that situation which is reducing the committee's earnings that come from produce tax.
a resident of Tembela location, Mbeya district William Mwakatobe too said that the pyrethrum board is supposed to look at the system of buyers who are oppressing farmer's rights and said that farmers have been selling pyrethrum flowers on credit and refused to pay the second payment.
Mwakatobe said that what is being done by pyrethrum buying companies is to take pyrethrum flowers on credit without paying in so doing causing farmers of that produce not to see the importance of continuing to farm that produce.
on his part, the manager of PCT company that buys pyrethrum in Makete district, Martin Oweka said that his company will make an effort of paying the debt being claimed and that there is a problem with their agents in the districts of Makete, Mbeya Vijijini, Ileje, Mufindi and Kilolo.
Oweka said that the problem (he didn't explain) has caused owing farmers money and even so they will pay all those debts after an analysis in the near future.
"it's not our policy to take on credit, we pay according to statistics, we send money every week, it shows that our agents are the problem," said Oweka.
on his part, an advocate from the ministry of agriculture, food, and cooperation Shani Mayosa said that failing to pay farmers and evading tax is an offense and that it's not a wise thing to continue issuing business licenses to buyers who are of no benefit to farmers.
furthermore, Pareto Board director Ephraim Mhekwa said that buyers are supposed to take into account, the quality of that crop in order to satisfy international standards and that the government has put in place plans to burn pyrethrum flowers that don't meet standards so that there be discipline in Pareto farming in the country.
he who does not follow will not get
written by Nicodemus Ikonko

today, I would like to start on our discussion with a popular saying which President John Magufuli in his slogan 'here's just work' which he has quickened significantly.
"he who does not work let him not eat.
"
in addition to the president including that saying, I believe many keen parents are well acquainted with this saying and implement it for very obvious reasons.
that if he does not get out of the house in the morning and go to work, farm or any other activities that is legal and will bring an income, he understands that his family will be in trouble if there is no food and other needs.
you can avoid consumption of many things by having numerous excuses but the subject of food budget, you cannot avoid it, from you the person who is looking for food to the person to whom your responsibility is to bring the food.
it should be remembered the biggest budget in our household or families it goes to provision of food first before anything else.
that's why there is another saying by our forefathers that say
"pray hunger for your enemy."
the war on famine can't be won for reasons not to face it.
even those with mental challenges, when hungry you will find them in dump sites looking for anything to put in their mouths.
there is no food supplement.
I want to emphasize that the big reason for the family and Government to use its resources more to train more of its youths together with chances to be innovative and enhance their talents to be able to look for daily upkeep in their life for them to be able to maintain themselves and continue with their lives.
on that program that ensures everyone is working 'to eat', I remember country's founding father, Mwalimu Julius Nyerere started the education philosophy of self-dependent in school then, that time the likes of me were schooling.
the intelligent ones understood him but as you know in the crocodiles habitat even the opportunists are there.
there those who ridiculed but in real life they are watching.
those who considered this saying are running their independent lives.
sometimes I ask myself about our youths of today both female and male.
he can finish his education in any level but he will just sit there at the home father, mother, uncle, in-law or even his friend without being restless and getting rid of the problems that he has by looking for activities that can bring in legal income.
who are you waiting to do that work for you?
think, a young man wants a job but he does not make any effort to write a letter or ask his companions where jobs are or even to read newspapers by himself that have different job advertisements every day.
how will this young man succeed to get a job?
another one understands that the work of casual laborers or the ones who call themselves day worker (day worker) is found in different areas of construction of houses, roads, factories and even in areas of fisheries, mentioning just a few but he does not go there, he sits at home waiting for food to eat then goes to his friends and gives them a recount of how Manchester United and Arsenal played yesterday on television.
and, will you get the casual worker?
please imagine you are in Dar es Salaam and you want to go to Arusha but you not buying a bus or plane ticket and neither do you have personal means of transport.
even if you lock yourself in the house with your whole family to pray until blood tears drop, there is no way to get in Arusha.
here, there is no miracle or trying to consult a witch doctor.
buy a ticket or have your own means of transport so that you start your journey to Arusha while praying God for journey masses.
here, I just want to remind our dear viewers mostly the youth that if you don't interact, don't blame witchcraft for your life but the witch who will be yourself as I said earlier, who doesn't work should not eat.
wake up and start being active.
man is job, otherwise the community will see you lazy and a big burden.
the Prime Minister has fired the Director of Water Lindi

when asked why he had not been in his office for a long time, the director said that he was in Dar es Salaam writing a financial application to resolve the various challenges facing the institution.
"how many days do you spend writing a proposal, a scholar you are using the whole month to write a proposal and staying in Dar es Salaam even your secretary does not know paying yourself allowances there!

lady destroys boyfriend's property
a guy from this area is counting losses after his girlfriend destroyed household items worth a fortune when she found him having fun with another woman at a club.
rumors say that the guy had known that wonderfully beautiful lady for the last two years and they became lovers.
after knowing each other, the two started a relationship and started visiting each other frequently.
later their relationship solidified and they decided to get married and started the wedding preparations.
"unluckily, the guy is not the type of person to be content with one woman and has several other lovers though his girlfriend does not know," said the source.
however, his forty days came to pass at the end of the week, when the guy came from work and as usual joined his friends to relax at a club that had organized music entertainment.
unfortunately, his girlfriend had earlier planned with her brothers to meet in order to make plans that our source did not elaborate.
the surprising thing is that they decided to meet at the club where the guy was relaxing with his friends, but he was not aware.
just as soon as the lady entered the club famous for organizing entertainment concerts known as Mugithi Nite, she saw her boyfriend embracing a lady as they passionately kissed in public.
seeing that, the lady was incensed, she went to the guy and confronted him, "so this is how things are," yelled the pretty lady.
"if you think I'm a person to be shared with club sluts then you'll see since today you'll know and you yourself will regret," said the lady.
according to a source, the pretty lady went out and boarded a motorcycle up to the guy's home, where she took a club and in anger broke electronic and furniture items and caused such a loss that the guy will never forget in his life.
it was not immediately discerned if the pair were reunited after the incident.

Missus Kenyatta wrote a story with Carolyne Agosa in April 13 as the first president's wife to run the London Marathon in European country.
she finished those 42 kilometer in seven hours, 05 minutes and 28 seconds.
it was not her first race.
earlier on March 9, she launched the first half marathon of Mother of the Nation, in the name of the First Lady's Half Marathon, in Nairobi as preparation for the London Marathon.
"today we ran so that we there can be a generation without HIV, to prevent the spread of HIV from the mother to the child.

SSRA comes with an alternate of Fao commitment
it is written by Halima Mlacha
published: 29 September 2016
when the commitment status continues to be discussed for the solution, the Management of and Management of the Social Security Sector (SSRA) has proposed the establishment of a post-employment Fao alternative.
the Fao will be issued to employees who have lost jobs by being dismissed or laid off at work but not to those who have decided to quit their own work.
the same authority has reported that approximately 23 million workers among the 25 million workers in the formal employment sector are equivalent to 91 percent.
2 did not join social storage bags.
the statement was made in Dar es Salaam last year by the Director of Research and Policy Ansgar Mushi, while presenting a topic on community conservation concept and the challenges of members opting out to contribute to community reserve bags, at a one-day press conference scheduled with that authority.
he mentioned the praises of Fao of the unemployment status as a member when he or she is proven to be dismissed or laid off, the fund will give him 33 percent of the employee's salary for a period of six months.
"only the terms of this Fao will be issued only to a 18-year-old employee who contributes for a period of 18 months for those who have contributed for less than 18 months will be given 100 percent of what they have donated," said Mushi.
he said another feature of the same, it does not affect employee pension benefits including other benefits provided by community pockets such as education, reproduction, treatment and disability.
he said the Fao of employment loss would not be given to an employee who left his own job because it would not be a disaster that needs help as the whole idea of the establishment of social security bags.
"our studies show up to 78 percent of employees who apply for the most dedicated Fao are senior professionals in the sense of being able to continue working elsewhere.
most of them are leaving their jobs with employment contracts elsewhere, asking for these funds only for other activities," he said.
Mushi said the goal of the establishment of social policing in accordance with the law and the constitution is to pay an employee pension to simplify his life during the period that he cannot earn income.
however, he stated that the impact of the donation is much as the employee has the opportunity to receive short-term benefits such as reproduction, education, disability and illness, loss of pension benefits and lack of liquidity in social stocks and so failing to pay bonuses to other deserving staff.
"in the case of Fao commitment, when an employee is paid he is taken off of the social security fund even when he becomes ill or have any catastrophe the fund does not recognize.
my office has been receiving just about 34,000 employees who have been given the donation offer now asking for rehabilitation," he stressed.
accordingly, the Legal Services Director of that authority Honorius Njole, said it was still at the stage of the debate and it was not approved while the debate on the Fao of commitment continued to receive comments.
he said in managing social security bags, the SSRA has set up 14 guidelines since its start of work in 2008, including the unlimited guidelines for the use of the bags, membership registration guidelines and records handling or member information.
other guidelines are for moving to any social reserve fund, investment guide, member financial security, social stock savings liquidity and guidance for boards trustees.
for its part, the SSRA Relationship and Mobilization Director, Sara Kibonde, said the community still needs to be educated about the importance of joining community stock pockets as it is useful to the whole community including those who are not present in the formal employment sector.
she said according to statistics of the authorities, the total number of employees present in the formal sector is 2 million.
1 out of 25 million workers attended.
"so approximately 23 million employees are equivalent to 91 percent
2 do not join these pockets."
she also said when pension funds have 2.1 million members, among them, social security pension bags are 1.1 million members while the health insurance fund is 920,701 members.
he said until now those funds have 105,057 pensioners, the contributions of those members that reach 1 trillion shillings.
69 and health insurance 88 billion shillings.
5, of which total is 1 billion shillings.

the acting leader of government business in parliament, Professor Mark Mwandosya has wanted members of parliament not to turn parliament into an acting area, as a result of their opinions that they present when they give their contributions.
he gave that opinion yesterday after there were heated exchanges between members of parliament when they were debating the motion on approving the basic treaty and regulations of public service and administration in the African continent, which was sent to parliament by the Minister in the Office of the President (Management of Public Service) Celina Kombani.

that politician reminded members of parliament that AG is the only person, who enters into all the pillars of authority which are government, parliament and the judiciary, an issue whose importance he wanted them to see.
there are members of parliament here who stood and rebuked the Attorney General that he isn't their lawyer, so he shouldn't correct them.
"I am saying here we are wrong, this is our lawyer here in parliament" said Professor Mwandosya.
he said even if members of parliament have their parliamentary lawyer, he doesn't enter parliament, therefore they must listen to the advice of the Attorney General when they are in various debates.
let me say that none is above the law, but under the law, there is an Attorney General, we better respect him," said Professor Mwandosya.
respect in parliament also he wanted members to tolerate one another and abandon surprising speeches, which can make the citizens believe that parliament is an acting field.
"well let's not make the citizens believe that parliament is an acting field, here we are honorable and we are wanted to respect each other and tolerate one another," said Professor Mwandosya.
earlier, before that speech from Professor Mwandosya, the Member of Parliament for Muhambwe Felix Mkosamali (NCCR-Mageuzi) attacked the Member of Parliament for Lushoto, Doctor Henry Shekifu that he can't give arguments with substance in parliament because he has fake academic certificates.
that speech from Mkosamali came out of Doctor Shekifu having called that member of parliament a child, therefore he should have respect for some members of parliament and for the things that are done by the government of CCM.
they engaged in an exchange in parliament as a result of that speech, Mkosamali stood up and asked to inform that member of parliament "honorable chair I am asking the member of parliament to stop calling me a child, I am a member of parliament who won with many votes and I lead a region like him."
"I am a member of parliament here and not a child, firstly this member of parliament doesn't know anything because he has never refuted the book and Msemakweli whom he is accusing of having a fake degree and so can't contribute a basic thing to this bill," said Mkosamali.
that speech by Mkosamali made Doctor Shekifu stand up and say he has forgiven that member of parliament because his speeches show that he is still a child.

Sydney cries to Tanzanian citizenship to do things
Imani Makongoro, Mwananchi imakongoro@mwananchi.co.tz
20 years ago the family of Wilhelm Gidabuday and Eva Balthazar had a son, Sydney, at the age of five, her parents began to teach him athletics at one of the athletic centers, California County, USA.
although Sydney's parents are Tanzanians who were born in Hanang in Manyara Region, their son is an American citizen by birth and in August this year he will carry the flag of the United States at the Olympic Games in Brazil, competing in 5,000 meters race.
reason for being American citizen "my parents were studying the United States, where I was born on August 21, 1996 in the city of Riverside, California County, USA.
"my parents told me when I was two years old I was brought to Tanzania, I joined with my Hanang colleagues and shepherding calves according to our traditions.
"class one I started in Arusha, Swift Academy, but later I was taken back to California to get my rights of free education, health and sports opportunities," reports Sydney.

we support 16 days against violence
written by Theopista Nsanzugwanko
published: 27 November 2016
the other day were launched 16 days against gender violence in the world that began on November 25 to December 10 this year.
the annual event aims to have a collective force in preventing the spread of the violence in the country in five regions by providing education and mobilizing public protest against gender violence and promoting the importance of safety education for all.
it is clear that this year those days are celebrated when the Ilala Police officials from the Ilala Police Station, Christina Onyango, say that the celebration has helped to increase community awareness, a step that has helped to receive more rape cases compared to previous years.
he said last year Ilala received 216 rape cases and among the cases, 25 were convicted for lack of evidence, but this year 226 cases were received and 112 were convicted.
so it is best for women in various areas to emerge in areas of the celebration in those days with a view to combating such violence and various training.
during those days many women are required to come out to get education, they will also meet and see how to deal with the various challenges that arise during struggle against gender violence.
but keeping quiet and closing your eyes on acts of violence is not a good thing, what is required is women coming out to provide sufficient evidence to combat gender violence in society especially women who are the greatest victims.
these 16 days should not be lost but be used as a guideline for society and ultimately they will help fight against the actions that are motivated by various factors in society.
do you always postpone the implementation of your activities?
how, when you have a matter you want to implement, J usually postpone until a time you think is very right?
have you ever regretted that if you could have done something at a certain time, you would have found success in your life?
if yes, why didn't you do it at that time?
what have you learned?
there are people who are accustomed every time to wait until the time they think was right to do a certain thing.
I remember the story of a young man who had a good job and a satisfying salary, who lived for a long time without marrying although he wished to marry.
he needed love, to have a household and children.
what caused him grief?
at one time he got a lover and involved his relatives and family until they planned for him a wedding.
but a day to the marriage, he changed his mind and cancelled getting married.
after that, every time he attempted marrying, he postponed, especially upon realizing that the girl he wanted to marry had a certain defect.
finally, he got a girl that he saw very suitable.
she was beautiful, attractive and with wisdom and very intelligent.
even so, one day that young man while sited with her preparing wedding plans, she uttered something that made him skeptical.
therefore in order to confirm she was a girl who was suitable, he decided to write for her regulations which he wanted her to agree to implement when they got married.
those regulations mentioned various things like the friends they deserve to have, the kind of work his wife deserves to be employed to do, what their sources of revenues for their livelihood will be, how their home where they will live will look like and how the division of labor between husband and wife will be.
also, he wrote other regulations concerning things like smoking, drinking liquor, the way of entertainment and other several things.
when his lover was given the list of these regulations, she refused them all and their engagement was broken.
the young man had mistakes that affect many people in their lives.
a human being can be careful not only in planning a wedding, rather even in various other things, like to choose jobs, build a house, buy a car, to start a project and others.
successes don't come as a result of our ability to remove all obstacles that confront the thing we intend to do, rather it is our ability to solve problems that will emerge when we will be implementing.
we don't have a choice in wisdom to decide the level that satisfies needs to start implementation.
it's not advisable to cancel a journey for fearing to encounter bridges or big forests, but with bravery let's cross those obstacles as we proceed forth with the journey.
the habit of postponing implementation of important things in life has affected the development of many people.
research has shown that people with huge successes are those who don't wait until tomorrow rather they start to implement today.
those with average success include individuals who decide to commence implementation even though by swaying from side to side.
those without success are those who wait until the situation will look appropriate then they decide to do a certain thing.
we must remember that all the successes we see in the world like wonderful machines, tall buildings and astonishing scientific inventions like sending equipment up to the moon and many others are a result of human thoughts.
but people who thought about ideas or these concepts, if they would have been undecided and disregard their speedy implementation they wouldn't have emerged.
if these inventors would have resorted to waiting until the appropriate time comes they would have ended up burying their thoughts.
it's good we remember that everything that we decide to do in life has two types of strength.
the first strength is that which makes the matter, that is being implemented to be hard which we may call 'difficulties'.
another strength is, that which makes that thing be able to be implemented with ease which we can call 'opportunity'.
people who hesitate to implement a certain thing, are those who allow their minds to be ruled by that strength of difficulties that make them wait until later.
but those who conceptualize the power in their minds, usually don't waste time rather act responsively.
one important subject that we should be compelled to learn out of this article is that in order for us to succeed in life we are obliged to be people of action and not people who like saying 'tomorrow', next week, next year or later.
let's not wait and to be patient by giving ourselves hopes until things become right.
implement once without wasting time.
meet with the difficulties and problems and solve them as you implement.
start from today, to implement things you think will bring you development.
don't waste time because periods pass and usually don't wait for someone.
controversy emerges when it comes to expertise about gold September 19, 2012
the minister of mining and energy Professor Sospeter Muhongo said that he will make sure the China National Gold Corporation (CNGGC) company which is in a hurry to buy more stock of 30 percent of Africa Barrick Gold (ABG) company that they start mining until ABG will pay all debts it owes the government of Tanzania and good citizens are informed.
that government position was released by Professor Muhongo confirming that ABG was having discussion and was ready to accept to sale their energy to CNGGC.
Professor Muhongo said they have started investigating that report that the Chinese company will not start mining in this country until ABG company clears all debt arising from mining in this country.
we will make sure all payment is made or else any company which buys energy from ABG will clear all debt before starting mining.
"we will continue following keenly and very closely because they are very clever and we need to be very careful," Professor Muhongo said.
if they will not clear the debt and they cheat the Chinese then the mining process will be difficult for them and will inform the ambassador of China to Tanzania about that company if buy energy from ABG company and should be prepared to clear all expenses that ABG failed to pay.
that sentiment by Professor Muhogo follows the position of his ministry of what action is taking against mining, natural gas and oil company who were escaping to pay rent for so long and some have resorted to sale their company to foreigners like what ABG wants to do.
those comments are brought up by the ABG reports through email such that, it has been in the conversation of selling some of his shares to that China Company.
the report that there is discussions approval also and ABG office in Dar es Salaam on his letter through his spokesman, Nector Foya, it proves that company it is on previous steps of discussion with that China Company.
"during that time, there is no prove of that discussion can reach to agreement that come out, it is still early that discussion can been finished if CNGGC will take more than 30 percent of ABG, compare with shares market of London (London Stock Exchange) ABG it proves that it has 4 billion pounds of shares.
1 in the shares market."
during the time ABG were giving that explanation, the report of the plan for educating openness through savings of minerals, gas and oil (TEITI) which is under the chairperson Judge Mark Bomani, it has put it open such that there is possibility ABG has a loan.
one officer of TEITI has said: "in the second report of TEITI for July 2009 up to June 2010, the total government income were 419 billion from quarry mines, gas and oil companies, in that division, paying revenue to any company is not good, they pay only seven percent, their claims is that they don't get profit."
that officer said those figures are according to second report, "while waiting to arrange the forth report6 of financial year 2012/2013 we are not sure if that company you talking about of ABG has paid revenue of income for the financial year 2011/2012."
ABG has several mines in the country, at some areas of Tulawaka, Biharamulo Kagera province, and Bulyanhulu, Kahama, Shinyanga and North Mara, Tarime Mara province.

steps to take when you decide to quit work
Christian Bwaya, Mwananchi bwaya@mwecau.ac.tz
in the previous article we saw the reasons why people quit work and the initial steps to be taken by someone thinking of making the decision to quit work.
we saw that it is important to be calm when making serious decisions.
a calm self-conscious person does not make decisions that are led by anger or even extreme happiness.
look for professional advice in order to achieve decisions based on accurate understanding of things.
there are advantages of quitting work by following formal procedures.
first, it helps you claim your entitled benefits in accordance with the law.
in order to obtain your dues, including any benefits you are entitled to according to the job contract, you will need official documents to confirm that you have quit the job.
moreover, respecting the contract also avoids the possibility of you getting into problems after quitting the job.
when you quit work without notice for any reason, a dishonest employer could count you as a deserter of duty and accuse you of theft of office property under your supervision.
there are workers who just after getting a good job, left in pomp and disregard to their employers.
others resigned with a 24-hour notice, believing they had nothing to lose anymore.
it was not as they had thought.
quit work in a manner that protects your working relationship with the employer.
you might not see those benefits today but in future bad relationships might cost you.
the new employer might contact your former employer to confirm that it is true that you quit work.
if you did not quit in the right procedure, you might find yourself losing the job that you were happy to obtain.
in this article we suggest good ways of providing notice of quitting work from your current employer and coworkers.
providing formal notice to the employer after ascertaining that you have followed the procedures of quitting work in accordance with the contract, the next step is to make formal communication with the employer that you now quitting work.
not many employers would enjoy encountering the issues of an employee quitting work, in a cafeteria.
avoid spreading such information before you have officially communicated with the employer.
an official notice of quitting work is important, if possible, it should be preceded with face to face talks with the employer.
in those talks, your employer gets a chance of receiving the bad news, in an unofficial environment before reading the official letter.
in writing the resignation letter, there are several factors to consider.
firstly, is to make clear your intentions that you are quitting work.
for example, your letter could have subject heading that states, 'RE: Quitting Work'.
words like, 'shifting work', 'tired of working conditions', 'switching jobs' could have many interpretations.
avoid words that have many interpretations.
after showing the purpose of your letter, write a sentence mentioning the last date you worked with your employer.
for example, 'I inform you that after great deliberation, at my own discretion, I have decided to make the decision of quitting work in order to get the opportunity to further my education.
the last working day is expected to be the Friday of date 03/31/2017.'
after mentioning the last working day, show appreciation by recognizing your employer's contribution in improving your experience.
briefly mention the opportunities you gained since you started work that you believe that built your skills and experience.
it is possible there are things you did not really like in the company/institution that you are leaving.
perhaps you had a dispute with your supervisor at work.
this is not the time to complain neither a reminder of past slights.
use positive language that does not express negative feelings.
in line with that, avoid mentioning your new employer or where you are intending to go.
the employer does not need to know of your plans after parting with him.
conclude your letter by requesting to be informed of any procedures for handing over of office.
conclude your letter by requesting to be informed of any procedures for handing over of office.
you can also show you are ready for an inquiry as to why you are quitting, giving the employer the opportunity to interrogate you on reasons that made you quit, how you will receive your entitlements, procedures of handing over of office, your readiness to help the new person who will take your place and other matters.
informing your colleagues, after the formal agreement with your employer that you are now quitting, what follows is to notify your colleagues.
the notice that you are now leaving can evoke emotions of jealousy.
when you inform them, respect their feelings.
it is true that you have quit and you are going to a better place.
maybe even your colleagues would like to go where you are going to.
do not make them feel as if they have nowhere to go by remaining with the employer that you are parting ways with.
you have no reason for fanfare by words or actions before and after leaving the work station.
there is no basic reason to explain why you have left and that where you are going, there are more benefits.
also, do not endanger your relationship with the employer you leaving by bad mouthing him to the colleagues that you are leaving.
even if it's true he has his weakness, even if the working environment you are leaving is inadequate, you have no reason of explaining that to the workers you are leaving.
say positive things.
give common reasons as to why you are quitting.
quit in a manner that will allow you to continue having good relationships with those you are leaving.
remember there is tomorrow!

after Doctor Ulimboka, how about Doctor Mkopi?
July 19, 2012.
the former poet who is a Roman by birth, Italy and genius of Latin language, Publius Ovidius Naso, popular known as Ovid, he said that, "in the total, the best doctor among others (in the world) is time.
Publius who was born on 20 March, year 43 (before Christ) who is been thought to live between 58 and 60 years, he is right up to today.
it is true, due to some of our doctors strike in the country, still Publius is continuing to be right.
this concept of Publius is pushing me to discuss the issue of doctors in this country and the measures taken by the government officials.
in this regard, eliminating strike from some doctors and beating of Doctor Steven Ulimboka (chairman of the doctors association), there's a matter of being taken to court for Doctor.
Namala Mkopi (the chairperson of the Medical Association - MAT).
first, let me confess that Doctor Mkopi's question should be discussed without interfering with the judiciary freedom, because he is already in court.
for that reason, I will discuss the action taken by the state organs before Doctor Mkopi is taken to court.
that is, I will discuss or question the precision of the reasons which persuaded the government officials to plan to arrest him in order to bring Doctor Mkopi to court.
basically, at the point of arresting Doctor Mkopi, there are many questions to ask yourself about involving government officials on one hand, but also by looking at his fellow doctors on the other hand.
let us ask ourselves these questions as we remember the poetry message of Publius that the best physician in the world is time.
regarding question number one.
this first question is about the decision of the state organs to arrest and sue Doctor Namala Mkopi.
in this first question, a number of arguments arise.
for example, what is the structure of the Medical Association of Tanzania (MAT)?
if you ask yourself the question you will note the structure mentions the chairman, the secretary, and the executive committee.
that means, anything about MAT cannot be a chairman's decision and in a particular setting it makes more sense to involve the secretary than the chairman because the secretary is the chief executive.
so, based on that structure, why has the chairman been arrested instead of the secretary?
from the beginning, with regard to media reports, mentions about doctors and striking were not issued by the chairman alone, but involved the secretary and the MAT executive committee in general.
think of it, why is it that the chairman is arrested?
without doubt, the right decision based on the government's perspective should be either to sue the entire MAT executive committee or the MAT secretary alone or both of them in general.
prosecuting Doctor Mkopi alone will be unfair.
arresting Doctor Mkopi is an offense to government officials.
it is a proof of what is called 'laziness' to accurately analyze things.
tiredness that is facing many government officials right now.
retired president Benjamin Mkapa once said that this kind of tiredness is mental laziness.
any command concerning any institution, (again a written order) including the one for calling off the strike is suppose to be written to the secretary of the relevant institution and the reason evidently being that the secretary is the executive and not the chairperson.
if the institution is been accuse, it means 'thoughts' that build up those accusations believe in the performance "that is unacceptable" of the relevant institution.
if so, it is definitely to be brought to court not Chairman Doctor.
Mkopi, who is also the only secretary or the chairperson and secretary in togetherness or all the committee for working of MAT.
this first question shows us a vacuum of thoughts among government officials.
regarding question number two.
the second question is, what have the state organs researched about Doctor Mkopi?
they claim he participated through MAT to encourage strike and even failed to prevent it.
what kind of setup influences (the state) to believe so?
there are detailed information among doctors that Doctor.
Mkopi wasn't participating in doctors' strike despite his colleagues participating in the strike.
I've talked to those close to Doctor Mkopi, who have been closely monitoring this issue of doctors' strike.
they confirm Doctor Mkopi did not participate in the strike but participated in helping to end the strike.
you may ask yourself, why didn't he participate in the strike?
there are reasons, and among those reasons is probably the type of patients he was treating and who he still treating.
but another factor is probably the desire of his heart.
Doctor Mkopi has been treating young children with cancer diseases.
his colleagues say his heart was "heavy" to strike against children with cancer at the Muhimbili National Hospital.
in this regard, some of his colleagues began telling him that as the chairman of the MAT he is betraying them, but he didn't care about that.
for him, the priority was treating children with cancer diseases.
Doctor Mkopi who was a pupil in Mapambano Primary School, Sinza in Dar es Salaam City and Tambaza and Azania Secondary schools (Dar es Salaam) for form one to four and form five to six, the doctor's calling did not persuade him to flee children who were suffering from cancer.
he treated the children he knew was a nation of tomorrow and if he had left them, then he would have "to answer" in the presence of the Almighty God.
in this context let's ask ourselves, can he encourage a strike capable of suing him personally rather than the institution (MAT)?
as poet Publius explained, time will provide answers.
it is still clear, the state has failed to investigate this issue.
certainly, it is a demonstration of unresponsiveness and lack of discretion within the custom system of the government.
if there were reasonable ideas and taking into account the position of Doctor.
Mkopi in the event of the strike, he should be charged with his secretary or the entire executive committee of MAT.
regarding question number three,
we saw a crowd of doctors that had gathered after Doctor Steven Ulimboka was brought to Muhimbili for treatment after abduction and torture.
I don't support Doctor Ulimboka beatings and the torture the same way, I don't support anybody undergoing such acts, in this country that is claimed to be peaceful and stable.
but I was happy with the solidarity and the unity among the doctors.
I expected doctors to appear there when Doctor Mkopi was arraigned in court with the same vigor.
it's true the doctors showed up at Kisutu court, but not with a similar vitality as of Doctor
Ulimboka.
what interpretation does this give?
interpretations can be multiple.
for example, it's possible since then doctors didn't have faith in Doctor Mkopi, probably because he was treating cancerous children all the time of the strike (he didn't strike).
but it's possible some of the doctors didn't arrive there (Kisitu court) because of other responsibilities or personal emergencies.
but it's also possible others thought it was good he was arrested despite his kindness of not striking.
the government was required to investigate this environment.
about the number four question.
question number four concerns the position of Doctor Mkopi after returning from the State House where the talks between MAT and the Doctors Association took place on one side with President Jakaya Kikwete on the other side.
after coming back from State House, Doctor Mkopi meet with the doctors.
in a special way, despite there being feelings that, the doctor's panel which came from State House has been sent to call off the strike, it is Doctor Mkopi who in a big way, persuaded his colleagues to return back to work (at least for several weeks).
in other meaning, is Doctor Mkopi who urge some of the doctors to take their faith back in the hope that, their grieves will be worked on after some of their colleagues meet with the President.
a person like this who brings back hope in that level especially in hard environment for been doubt by his colleague, cannot cause the strike.
in other way, a person of this character will continue to look for solution.
it is possible even inside the institute (MAT) Doctor Mkopi was persuading his colleagues to look for a solution.
law enforcement agencies were supposed to investigate Doctor Mkopi's position inside MAT before taking action against him personally.
with no doubt, the time shall tell as he said, poet Publius.
about question number five
the fifth question is about the general behavior of charging Doctor Mkopi in his position as the chairman.
his being charged is associated to his position in MAT.
without a doubt, other characters, as I had said earlier, were supposed to be here or it's only him (Doctor
Mkopi) and his secretary general or both of them and the executive committee of MAT.
by bad luck the accused is Doctor Mkopi who if those children suffering from cancer are questioned or the their parents, without a doubt they will remember Doctor.
Doctor Mkopi treated you during the strike so he never went on strike.
those children or their parents will be saddened whenever they hear that the doctor who had treated them is the one charged for instigating the strike.
this environment should have been researched by Commonwealth institutions.
the way things are, the content of the fifth question in this article brings us a message, Doctor Mkopi is being tortured psychologically.
by bad luck, many of us are hurt by the suffering underwent by Doctor Ulimboka but we don't care about the psychological pain being experienced by Doctor Mkopi.
the pain that many can recognize is maybe the children that he used to treat for cancer in Muhimbili.
my call is that, the government officials should research on this question keenly.
God bless Tanzania, God bless Africa
Sheria Ngowi: discontinuance is the measure of just clouds.
October 06, 2016 by our online writer
it is not easy for the fashion designer to get to the point of being popular and reaching out to many people.
it requires to be with high level of creativity.
the biggest designers in the world for many years did not reach to those reputations easily.
it is by work and talent especially.
for a designer to be considered among the biggest designers, he must be successful in the major fashion towns in the world like Paris, New York and Milan.
and that is how it is for the likes of Gabrielle "Coco" Bonheur Chanel, Donna Karan, Giorgio Armani and Calvin Klein.
it is also the same thing to the likes of Donatella Versace, Ralph Lauren, Pierre Cardin and Yves Saint Laurent.
it does not matter how long the designer has been around, but prosperity depends on the same things.
and those are what our Tanzanian youth Sheria Ngowi went through.
yet he has not managed to travel to those fashion towns of the world, but nothing is preventing him from doing so.
it is true that many of the popular fashioners in the world come from the country of France and America and few from Italy.
but the truth remains there there that Sheria Ngowi for now is in his own space in this field of fashion especially for men clothes.
and that is why I have the audacity to say that to all the Tanzanians to be behind him and to support him, he will reach to also to be known more in the East African countries, Africa and later New York, Paris and Milan will be just time.
white men say, only the sky is the limit.
together with the popularity of this youth in fashion, he is also in the social network just like many other businesses across the world at the moment.
and that's exactly why I would like to look at this youth.
in Twitter, Sheria Ngowi is followed by 32,818 people and follows 644 people.
among the famous people that he is following in Twitter include senior national leaders like Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa, President John Magufuli and several ministers.
also, there is a respected intellectual in the country called Professor Issa Shivji.
others are renowned politicians in the continent of Africa like Dlamini Zuma who is the chairperson of the African Union Commission, Kizza Besigye who is the leader of the opposition in Uganda, Allassane D.
Quattara, the President of Ivory Coast.
also he is following Barack Obama, Mike Tyson and Calvin Clein.
in Facebook he is followed by a total of 19,229 people.
this makes him to be among the Tanzanians with a great influence in different social media.
in a big way he uses Facebook in order to show different clothing designs, especially men's suits.
in addition to showing clothes and different styles there are issues that he has been writing about and pleases me truly.
he uses all two languages of English and Swahili with great eloquence.
one of those issues is when he wrote that, and I quote," all days I have been believing and knowing that every part of my life has been a part of God's plan because of me".
every step that I make, takes me closer to my real dream.
father told me to be patient, and most importantly to pray because of greatness.
in Twitter he uses that website mostly because of informing Tanzanians on different matters happening in the country that is together with putting pictures of those happenings.
this is as a result of the truth that the Twitter social media has been used more by people who instead of putting matters concerning them more personally, instead they have been putting national issues or development thoughts more, different from other media.
in the day that I am preparing this article is the day that by good luck this stylist is born.
I wish him good memories of being born, good life and more greatness in designs and fashion in the country and in the world.
Mbinga, set an example in the effective use of land
written by the Editor
published: 14th December 2016
yesterday, this newspaper published an article that carried the headline 'Mbinga Council surveys 70,000 plots.'
the report ascertained that the council, which is in the province of Ruvuma, has completed the task of identifying various areas for housing, open areas and allocating sites for key social services.
the executive director of the council, Gombo Simandito, explained that the action that the council took was in line with the implementation of a government order that requires every piece of land in the country to be surveyed in order to enable its owners to obtain a legal document that would help them acquire legal entities and serve in financial institutions as a guarantee of mortgage and capital.
we would like to congratulate that council by taking that firm step, which will in a normal way, will enable that council to have a good arrangement for building houses, social services, and business areas and thus enable it to have an appearance and good arrangement for use of their areas.
there is no argument also that the step will reduce fights for areas between the people because according to that process, everyone will understand early before taking any action of or of buying or building an area, to be able to identify with certainty that it's owned by who and that what has been planned to be in the concerned area.
we would like to call on all councils in the country, to adopt this good example of allocating land use so that the locals can be sure of the use of their areas without quarreling or worrying that they will be moved.
there are many areas here in the country, with major land disputes especially between farmers and pastoralists, to a level that sometimes causes great destruction to property including houses, livestock, and even killings as a result of not separating between agricultural, pasture and residential areas and thus becoming a major catalyst of conflicts inside the concerned communities.
we would like to advise directors in the districts marred by conflicts between farmers and pastors, to also use the land specialists in their areas, to ensure that they take measures to survey and to specify how different areas will be used in order to avoid unnecessary conflicts.
we believe that the main reason for having land management officers at different levels of councils and districts is to use their expertise, to plan effective use of land and ensure that these areas are used for the intended purpose.
here we also like to remind the Ministry of lands and housing development, to remind its officers at the council and district level, to manage and implement by action the government's good intention concerning good land usage by ensuring, it has been properly measured in order to be able to have a plan that will bring profit from the usage of their areas and to enable them also to acquire title deeds, which will enable them to use them in various financial institutions, to access loans and to use them to break off from the pit of poverty by starting various projects.
this is possible, we should take firm measures to manage and implement the best use of land.
Mbinga have done it, why shouldn't the other councils follow their example?
Diana is Miss Tanzania 2016
written by Alexander Sanga, Ilemela
published: 31 October 2016
the former Miss Kinondoni, Diana Edward is the beauty of Tanzania 2016 after beating her 29 companions at Rock City Mall grounds the day before yesterday at night in the province here.
those very big competitions in this country were decided by judges who are: Rita Mbelo, Catherine Kibaso, Sophia Masei, Raphael Siantini, Joe Makanyaga, Eliza Kilili, Juma Sultan, Prashant Patel and Ramesh Shah.
those competitions started by the beauties dancing to different songs before walking up and down with creative dresses, beach wear and evening dress.

language and nationalism, similar to rice and mixed rice, bananas and banana soup.
April 26th, 2015.
I would like to finish this row by insisting on two or three things that relate to the Swahili language in the context of building the nationalism of our country.
I will also insist on the importance of the tradition of self-belief, self love and self respect.
as I had earlier said, not every country is a nation.
there are many countries that are not nations.
and at the same time I said that there are nations that have stayed without a country for a long time, but stayed as nations even if they had the trouble of struggling in the world.
a nation means people who recognize themselves as one, with one beginning and a common future.
the importance of language in nation building cannot be ignored.
the current state makes me doubtful about the way we view language.
on one side, many children born in the cities don't know their mother tongues, especially if their parents come from different tribes.
many times, even for the children born to parents from one tribe find themselves being brought up by house helps who speak Swahili.
these kind of children totally part ways with their mother tongues, and their language becomes Swahili alone.
that situation is different in the villages where children still speak their language of origin until the time they start going to a primary school where they find Swahili.
then, all children find themselves forced to learn all the subjects in English when they get to secondary school, and their exams to test their skills are written in English.
all the other engagements in a country's life happen in Swahili apart from the engagement to look for education.
this is strange!
our politics (the same useless politics) take place in Swahili.
the debates in parliament (the same useless ones) take place in Swahili.
when we communicate in offices and factories, in workshops and in resolving technical issues, we do so in Swahili.
when we are in worship, many times we use Swahili.
it is the reason even the shepherds brought from outside are forced to learn Swahili.
engagements like marriage, courtship, fundraising and weddings take place in Swahili.
while we are in funerals, we also bury each other in Swahili.
even in quarrels, I have never seen a quarrel between two Tanzanians happening in English.
but in seeking skills from schools and colleges, when we want to plan and protect our youth's skills and recognize those who qualified and distinguished, that activity is done in a language that isn't ours.
there's no logic.
our courts which are many and for a long time have been conducted in Swahili but the laws governing those courts are written in English.
I remember the late Francis Nyalali while he was the high court judge spoke more about this for more than twenty years ago.
however, there are no visible sincere steps to correct this error.
there are several reasons that are making our courts not to give justice to the weak, and many among those reasons relate to corruption acts as we know.
but one of the reasons that is denying the weak justice is the one of being judged on laws that they would never read no matter how much they put effort to, leave alone understanding them.
if it happens that our laws get written in a language understandable to many, the people with counsel in courts will be able to know what their right is, and they will be able to defend themselves even without having lawyers whom they are forced to that much amount of money.
it will be bad luck to my learned brethren, but very good luck to the common citizens.
to give a deserving status to a language we call national is important in nation building and in the building of a self believing heart.
at the moment we have become people who do not believe in ourselves.
as I wrote in the past, we have degraded ourselves to a value that we give to ourselves.
language is one of the examples in the degrading of our worth.
I have heard the youths in town saying that a European dog is better than the Bongo Swahili speaker.
I have also heard a Bongo flavor song saying that after God is the white man.
the level of contempt we do to ourselves is huge beyond measure.
it's contempt which has been built for a long time resulting from many things.
one of it is a huge leadership deficit in ideas and vision.
it is true that we are floating like a boat without a captain for now while, we're seeing symptoms of hungry crocodiles and sharp edged rocks in the water.
in our confusion from the lack of leadership, every passenger and every assistant captain is doing their best to save themselves.
in the shakeups we're causing ourselves, our boat is swaying and seeping in water.
the end of this suspense is our vessel rolling and finally sinking and all passengers perishing.
in-laws quarrel a drunkard, a tormentor of their sister.
this kind of spectacle has happened in this area when a drunk man was found in a bar with his in-laws who beat him up badly, claiming that he had married a lady whom he loved from nearby village and with whom he went to school four years ago.
"even though that lady was strongly warned against marrying the drunkard who was known for his addiction to excessive drinking, the lady totally refused to listen to her family members and asked them to cease interfering with her personal life," said our reporter.
their marriage had been peaceful for a while without any complication since their union.
moreover that couple had been blessed with one son.
however, things changed two years ago.
for unknown reasons, their home became a theater of confrontations every time.
according to the reporter, sometimes those confrontations sparked a war within that couple.
however, things got out of hand one grim day when their impasse turned into a fierce battle between them.
"it was during this war, when a man threw his wife breaking her hand," explained the reporter.
it was after this war, that the woman packed up her belongings and returned to her parents and her brothers took her to hospital for treatment.
this event angered her brothers who decided to search for the man whom they intended to teach a lesson for intimidating their sister.
since the man is a drunkard, they found him within a very short time in one club drinking alcohol and confronted him.
"so, after trying to kill our sister have you come here to celebrate?"
one of them fumed."
"today you will discover that she has people who are able to protect her," he said.
together, they began to beat him up mercilessly regardless of being at a public place.
however, the man was rescued by customers who intervened and urged the brothers to leave him alone.

health officer locked in the warehouse
Patrick Mabula, Kahama. the health officer for Kahama district Moster Charles Mwaipopo the day before yesterday found himself in a difficult situation after he was locked in a warehouse for more than five hours when he was doing an inspection.
Mister Mwaipopo was locked in a warehouse belonging to businessman Mister Lucas Kishimbe who admitted locking in the health officer when he had gone to inspect the goods that are in the warehouse. the businessman Mister Kishimbe said he decided to lock the officer inside after he threatened to set on fire the goods that are in the warehouse if he did not give anything claiming they did not have the quality assurance from the factories where he buys them. Mister Kishimbe said the officer arrived at his warehouse and identified himself as coming to do an inspection and he opened for him including the inner doors, but while in there he asked to be given money and that is when he refused and he threatened to set the goods in there on fire.
he said that after being threatened is when he decided to lock him inside the warehouse and sought help from his superior district health officer Mister Athanas Ng'oboko who denied sending him to do that work and making threats so that he is given something.
the district health officer Mister Ng'oboko when asked admitted the locking in of the officer and denied that he was not an employee in the district authority but is an employee of the town authority and that he did not send him to carry out that work which he says he probably had a plan of getting money for himself from the businessman who locked him the warehouse.
and health officer for Kahama town authority Mister Marten Masele when asked admitted the occurrence of the incidence but denied that Mister Mwaipopo is not under that authority and neither did he send him to carry out inspections in businessmen's warehouses in Kahama town.
on his part, officer Mwaipopo admitted being locked inside Mister Kishimbe's warehouse and explained that he went there following the directive of Food and Drugs Authority "TFDA" from Mwanza City that the businessman has a habit of importing goods that do not have quality standards, something that he refused to be inspected. Mister Mwaipopo said that while locked in the warehouse he made a call to his fellow officers who came arrived with police officers and that is when they saved him and when he was released by the businessman.
however, reliable and long standing reports from some of the citizens and health officers in the Kahama district health authority and from Kahama town authority say a big percentage of businessmen in the district have adopted a dirty game for long as they usually take goods in that state something that endangers the health of the consumers.
where does that confidence come from?
July 05, 2012
unfortunately, for several weeks now after having another doctors' strike in the country, there are Tanzanians who support that strike.
there are those who support it on grounds that services in the health sector needs to be improved, but there are those who support it believing there are political benefits that they can get either individually or with their associations.
whatever the case, we believe that there are no reasons that will convince a critical patient who needs the services of the doctors, to endure suspension of health services as a way of supporting the doctors' strike to proceed forth.
if only the groups supporting the doctors' strike could get to the wards in some of the hospitals in the country to get the opinions of the patients as whether the strike should continue or not, without a doubt the patients would want that strike to be halted, soonest possible.
unfortunately, those giving the opinion indicating support for the strike are not sick and maybe have no patients who are affected by the strike.
they can't know a patient's misery failing to get the services of the doctors.
on our side, we collaborate with all the patients to request doctors to return to work, to save the lives of their fellow human beings whose lives cannot be used as a ransom to fulfill any other claims.
it is against the law and humanity to force implementation of certain clams using someone else's life.
the medical profession gives doctors the right to protect human life through treatment whenever they fall ill.
it is not just, for patients' illnesses to be used as a 'shield' for doctors to compel the government to pay them the dues they deserve.
in simple terms is that, striking on patients is cruelty against human rights.
let's ask ourselves, where does that courage to strike on patients come from?
our advise is that the press should head to hear the opinions of the patients instead of pursuing to hear the activists or politicians who primarily don't know the discomfort or pain of lacking treatment.
we still ask ourselves, where does this confidence of the doctors to continue sabotaging the patients not for a few hours but for several weeks come from?
is it courage to claim interests only, is it because of improving health services in the country alone?
but if it's about improving healthcare services and doctors' needs, if those requests are met, will we be able to restore the lost lives because of the strike?
the main fears of Peshawar's residents is now mice
Peshawar, Pakistan despite living with the fear of bombing attacks, residents of the city of Peshawar, Pakistan are currently living in panic of being attacked by mice.
the residents say that for now, instead of fear of terrorist attacks of Taliban militants, they have turned their backs against mice, who have injured them by eating thousands of chickens, besides spreading a serious illness that has led to the death of one child.
one of them is Naseer Ahmad, who has been in the front line to deal with the mice.
he says that in the past 18 months, he has been able to kill more than 100,000 mice.
"this is the responsibility I have made after seeing my friend taking his wife to hospital after a mouse bite," said Ahmad, as he continued to search for the mice in Zaryab in the area.
"he was forced to use 4,500 shillings to be given an injection to prevent the disease," he said.
the mice are said to be 22 to 30 centimeters long.

KCMC needs 100 specialist doctors
written by Arnold Swai, Moshi
published: October 30, 2016
KCMC Referral Hospital located in Moshi in Kilimanjaro region, currently faces a shortage of 100 specialist doctors.
the shortage, despite being one of the key health care centers in the North and more than 20 regions and neighboring Kenyan region.
speaking at the opening of the third conference of the Tanzania Kidney Specialists Association (NESOT), opened by the Deputy Minister of Health, Social Development, Gender, Elderly and Children, Doctor Hamisi Kigwangalla, Acting Director of the KCMC Referral Hospital, Sarah Urassa , said far from the deficiency there was also a lack of nurses in accordance with the proposal.
Urassa said KCMC Hospital has 62 specialist doctors, as well as ordinary doctors who are coming out of KCMC about 117, which causes the presence of 100 specialist doctors in the hospital.
she said the hospital can not stand without nurse's union, where it currently has 242 nurses, where required by the union is 414, so there are 172 nurses shortages, with 177 nursing staff and required according to the union is 264 so there lack of 84 nurses.
she explained that the hospital has employees from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (secondment), the employers of the Good Samaritan Foundation, who are volunteers and who are present on contract after retirement.
Urasa said the number of formal beds in the hospital is 605, the number of patients exceeds in the bone surgery and cure wards, a condition that requires extra unusual beds placed on the outside of the wardrobe.
speaking of service delivery in 2015, the hospital reported 176,331 outpatients, with an average of 420 patients per day, reported 21,888 inpatients, with an average of 60 patients on average per day.
Urassa reported patients' statistics and percentages on barriers based on regional origin, in which inside the referral section northern region Kilimanjaro Region (88-90), Arusha (7- 10), Manyara (2-4) and Singida (1) -2).
she said outside the referral area the region of Dodoma (14-18), Dar es Salaam (11-14), Iringa (3-5), Mbeya (1-3), Kigoma (1-4), Lindi (1), Mara (3-13), Mtwara (1), Mwanza (4-6), Coast (1-2), Rukwa (2-3), Shinyanga (5-7), Ruvuma (1-2), Tabora (6-8), Kagera (3-6), Njombe (1), Geita (1), Katavi (1), Simiyu (1), Zanzibar (3-16), neighboring Kenya (7-16) and tourists (1-2).
the investment environment continues to be improved in the country.
September 29, 2016
Tanzania has been the 116th country out of 138 in the year 2016-2017 as a result of a good environment that attracts investment in all sectors of the world.
that was said yesterday by the acting director of the research institute of REPOA, Doctor Lucas Katera, when he was announcing results of a research that was done by his institute in Tanzania in regards with the position of the country in developing a favorable investment environment in the world.
"this research was done in 138 countries, but we at REPOA did on the side of Tanzania, where there were 12 criteria that were researched for all countries, whereby in Tanzania, we identified some of the criteria that the country seems to perform well while the other criteria requiring more improvements," said Doctor Katera.
he mentioned some of the criteria that seem to do well to be: security of the government, public health, position on policy, management and control of foreign currency together with management of the job market.
"the criteria that seem to need major improvements are the availability of loans, many taxes again at a big level, weak infrastructure, bribery together with bureaucracy in government when an investor comes with an intention of investing here in the country since there has been much bureaucracy in the government," said Doctor Katera.
he said even though Tanzania has been the 116th country in the year 2016/2017, but it's a big step compared to past years whereby, in the year 2013/2014 it was in the position of 125th, in the year 2014/2015 it held the position of 121st and the year of 2015/206 it held the position of 120th, therefore it has continued to climb up, although at a small speed.
he highlighted that, the government is required to improve the quality of higher education and the training that is provided in the country, after it was clearly shown to be faced with major challenges of certainty of the labor force to the investors emerging from the education provided at high levels to not seen to be having the required quality especially in the fields of science and technology subjects.
"even you journalists I think you remember the year 2010 there were jobs that were advertised in the sector of natural gas here in the country, but they were not found those who satisfy the required qualifications, therefore this is a big challenge that needs a solution because when investors come to invest here in the county, they want to find workers with attributes and quality that is required," said Doctor Katera.
and one of the panelists who did that research, researcher Cornel Jahari of that institute said that research was done in the province of Dar es Salaam because, 75 percent of taxes come from Dar es Salaam because of the many companies and many industries investing in the province here whereby they interviewed chief business executives, small small together with big businesspeople, in industries and the agricultural sector.
the global competition institute (GCI) for the first time in the world economic forum in the year 2005 began the plan of recognizing countries with the best environment in the world of investment, through the 12 criterion provided by that institute whereby research is done in every country in the world.
the top ten countries which according to that research are leading in having the best investment environments are: Switzerland, America, Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Britain, Japan, Hong Kong together with Finland whereby in the East Africa (EAC) region, the country of Rwanda has been seen to do well, followed by Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Burundi is the last.

the women's magazine: let's participate in the preparations for the holiday.
written by Theopista Nsanzugwanko
published: 18 December 2016
this is the last week for the preparations of the Christmas holiday and the New Year, therefore, every family is preparing to have in place strategies to ensure these holidays are done with love and peace.
it's good for women to participate in the holiday plans by ensuring the children are happy by the ability they have without looking at certain families' plans in celebrating those holidays, since it's good to look if you have the ability to travel, it's good to do that way and if you have no ability it's good to do the celebration at your home.
in these holiday times, there has been a tendency by some women to require a great deal of needs beyond their ability and without looking at other responsibilities that are in front of you, that isn't right at all.
since as women you are required to look at priorities and even in the buying of new clothes, you can do that for the children alone but you can also cultivate in them a culture of being bought clothes any time whenever there is money and not a must on holiday seasons, since that issue can result in conflicts among the children in the family just for missing out on the clothes.
with love if you live like a family, it's good to look at the ability that's present and to put united plans by giving preference to love in those preparations, holidays will be done in love and to a high standard even if there various economic challenges.
for certain women are the pillars of the family hence it's good to be the managers of these preparations if it's together with helping each other in the family in various issues with the little you have and not waiting for everything to be done by your husband.
that's when you'll see the importance of having something to do and stop being just idle waiting to be fended for, certainly when you'll give your contribution to the celebrations and even to other responsibilities of the children for the next month, your worth to your husband increases in seeing that he truly has a helper in the house.
therefore, in actualizing everything, there must be love that will bring happiness and peace in your house during the whole preparations period even in future holidays.

in fact we shall be extremely brave, super energized and we shall not be scared to face criminals even if they are heavily armed," insisted one of them.
speaking with this newspaper, the commander of the Sungusungu army, Mahona Boniface said the tattooing is a direction from their Sungusungu lord called Clement Mbogatabu which he gave soon after being chosen to take that position in the recent elections.
"I am the one who alerted collection of these police and give them the instructions from our Sungusungu lord they all complied and today we are gathered in this field where every police officer has been instructed to carry along his own new razor blade and an amount of 500 shillings as fee to the doctor who will tattoo him," said Mbogatabu.
those traditional doctors hired to do that job were mentioned as Juma Aron, Shinje Buzuka and Lutema Mugesa while the name for the fourth doctor was not available.
he said that the doctors are from Uzia village and the other one is a resident of Santaukiwa village which are in the valley of river Rukwa in Sunbawanga district where they conducted the activity from nine in the morning to two at noon.

published: 14 November 2016
Minister of Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, Nape Nnauye has praised the efforts made towards the fixation of the artificial turf at the old stadium of Nyamagana, here in the province.
speaking during the assessment of the stadium, Nape requested the contractors to do their best in the construction of the stadium, to ensure it becomes the best in East Africa.
Nape said the government will continue to support the construction of the stadium while requesting various investors such as the banks and pension funds to assist in the laying of platforms and seats in the stadium.

the ministry of health has undertaken certification improvements and seals of yellow fever vaccines.
minister of health, community development, gender, elderly and children, Ummy Mwalimu has launched certificates and new seals for yellow fever vaccines.
Ummy said the delivery of the vaccine of the disease in the country is facing the challenge of the presence of some dishonest citizens who are faking vaccination certificates and giving them to travelers without being vaccinated.
and that in order to eradicate the deception, it has decided to upgrade the old certificates by placing hidden marks.
"as a result of technological changes, old certificates have been easy to be made by the conmen and given without vaccination. therefore, the ministry has made improvements on certificates of vaccination of yellow fever by putting secret marks and making new seals," he said.
he said the yellow fever disease is dangerous because it has no cure and that the government has seen it fit to protect the travelers, especially that the World's Health Organization recently reported the outbreak of the epidemic.
"if you remember in late March 2016, I gave a warning of yellow fever due to the report of the presence of the disease in neighboring countries of Kenya, Angola and the DRC," he added.
"recently, the World's Health Organization gave a report on the outbreak of the epidemic that began in December 2015 and resulted in the death of 377 people and 4,347 patients in Angola while in DRC 121 people lost their lives.

self-awareness is overcoming selfishness, caring for the needs of others?
we began to foster the issue of self-awareness in the previous article.
as we have suggested, self-awareness goes hand in hand with understanding the push behind what we do every day.
in this section, we will briefly consider why self-awareness is more than the 'selfishness' within us.
not listening to the wishes of others?
the issue of self-awareness has a long and controversial debate.
every community, culture and even one person, looks at this matter with a different eye.
in communities that promote personal independence, for example, 'we' are what we have within us that enable us to self-reliance and feel like free people who are alienated from 'bondage' of the expectations and wishes of others.
for this reason, self-awareness is giving your self the ability to enter into ourselves, to examine and to bring out what we have without considering so much the opinion of others.
entry into ourselves means to investigate our personal goals - which can be quite contrary to the expectations of others - to see how we can bring personal benefits.
in this regard, some people remain with two types of contributions to us; it is either helping us or discouraging our goals.
of the first group, they must accept and respect our selfishness and thus we give them the opportunity to continue being with them; of the second group we separate ourselves from them, for one big reason, and they are struggling with their selfishness and thus they do not see the value of selfishness (the-us) we have.
put forward our personal goals?
we use one simple example
when a young begins life, he finds himself in the middle of many responsibilities with a mixture of his personal expectations and the community surrounding him.
this young man with a low salary finds himself obliged to choose what to achieve personal goals and to support his dependents as relatives, friends and community around him.
if we use the above explanation, it means this young man is self-aware, then he's forced to choose to go ahead "in development" and never adjust according to the expectations of others that are directed towards him.
Well say he is ready to end up close association with non-assistant friends, to cut off his contacts with his poor brothers in his village who are primarily 'struggling to delay the imagination of his dreams'.
these measures to 'isolate himself from social discomfort' are mandatory in order to give the young man the opportunity to focus on achieving his goals beyond the expectations of those who depend on him.
that, however, does not mean that the young man should be separated from society or not to compare himself with others in the community.
no.
the young man is expected to follow closely with youth groups who have "a development viewpoint" that can give him the motivation to reach his own goals.
usually, this young man's goals are concentrated on wealth and wealth rather than helping the poor community around him.
if it is education, it must help him in the pursuit of wealth.
otherwise, that education has no meaning
likewise, comparing yourself with others is important.
so as he continues 'to succeed' this young man should be obliged to increase his faith and desire to meet his personal needs by looking at the way he goes and the speed of his "fellow peers" and how he becomes better than young men 'who have no development viewpoint".
basically, his happiness increases as he becomes better than others and increases personally.
what is important is his personal goals.
how are the prospects of others?
the second perspective of self-awareness is in sharp contrast with the first one.
self-awareness means to understand what others expect of us.
in social communities that value unity and kinship, it's easy to understand this viewpoint.
self awareness isn't looked at with the eyes of our personal wishes only.
that is to say 'we' does not interfere with the expectations of the surrounding community or groups we identify with it even though we sometimes disagree with them.
identifying yourself, in effect, is going out of our personal desires.
self-awareness is to benefit from others, to rely on others and at times to look and evaluate ourselves by turning back to our relationship with others.
in this context, the main question of 'who are we' is, 'how do others view me?'
people of my group, my party, workmates, people of my faith, my family what do they expect of me?
what do I have to give people around me?
so we see here self-awareness is the willingness to go ahead of desires, wishes, personal goals and test ourselves by how we can contribute to the well-being of those around us.
to accept to be delayed?
when we return to the example of the young man we mentioned earlier, the young man will be aware if he will be able to look at the space he has in the community.
the young man will be aware that he will be able to decide to take care of others even if it costs the delay of his wishes and personal desires.
that (the young man) be ready to consider what he can do in his ability to help his poor brothers in the village and others around him.
the young man will be aware if he will be able to delay his dreams of looking like the 'urban youth' in order to be the answer to the challenges of the people he knows need him.
that is possible if the young man is ready to keep in touch with 'helpless' friends because he understands that the friends probably need him.
the confusion that has no reality?
in conclusion, it is probably good to remind ourselves that self-awareness can not be one day's event.
self-awareness is a long journey because, as we have seen, there are differences in perspectives that can affect how we measure our self-awareness.
when we think we are aware of ourselves, sometimes, others see us in the opposite direction.
likewise, it is the truth that is well-known that we are doing much with a push that we do not understand well.
sometimes we do not know why we are doing what we do.
for example, we may have some tendencies that we do not like but we continue to have them.
can we understand and still not know why we are doing what we do?
could that not be evidence of why we sometimes do not even know ourselves when we think we know ourselves?
maybe
that, however, does not mean we can not be aware of ourselves.
or are you winning 'the-me'?
since we love the conclusions, I conclude it in my personal opinion.
the question of 'who are we' is the question of self-awareness.
self-awareness is a combination of understanding us (we ask ourselves that question) what we want, and so forth, others who surround us expect what from us.
similarly, self-awareness is to recognize and acknowledge our position and accept our responsibility as an essential part of responding to the needs of others.
self-awareness is the appreciation for others, motivating others, raising others with no hope for them except the happiness that comes from what we can benefit others even when it comes to our cost.
self-awareness is to know where our happiness is.
the happiness that comes from benefiting and raising others for justice.
self-awareness is winning the-me.
do you agree with this view?
is it possible?
it is going on

those with severe injuries to the earthquake taken to MOI
written by Angela Semaya, Dodoma.
published 15 September 2016
some of the earthquake victims which happened in Kagera, those who suffered serious injuries and bone disorders, can be taken to Dar es Salaam at the Orthopaedic institute of Muhimbili National Hospital (MOI) for further examination and treatment.
the Minister for Health, Social Development, Gender, Elderly and Childhood, Ummy Mwalimu said the Ministry has organized and participated appropriately so the victims of the earthquake who got bone problems be transported to be treated at the institution.
Ummy noted this at the conclusion of the debate of the 2016 General Chemistry Laboratories Bill and Chemistry Specialists Management Bill 2016.
he said the government's intention is to see injured get immediate treatment so that they can recover and gave relief to all victims affected by the incident, which occurred on September 10, this year in the region and neighboring regions of Mwanza, Geita and Shinyanga.
up to Tuesday, the government said the total number of 17 people died from the earthquake and 252 others were injured.
the State Minister Office of the Presidential Administration and Local Government (Tamisemi), George Simbachawene said this while he was reading a state statement in the Parliament on the behalf of the Prime Minister.
Simbachawene said the incident occurred at nine o'clock in the afternoon and its size was 5.7 in Richter tests.

Mrema should be supported to reduce prisoners in prison
written by Lucy Ngowi
published: 21 September 2016
President John Magufuli on July 16, this year, appointed Augustine Mrema to be chairman of the national parole board.
Mrema, who is also the chairperson of Tanzania Labor Organization (TLP), was not at first understood what he was doing in comparison with the parole's work I knew, I did not think they were same.
immediately after his appointment, Mrema met with Bajaj and Bodaboda riders, who were in Kinondoni district and asked them to write down names of the police asking for bribes to report to President Magufuli.
Mrema understood clearly that when the riders were asked to pay the bribe and are unable the next thing was a trial case and then sent to jail where there was a great deal of delay.
Mrema too met drug addicts in the Manzese area and talked with them.
he admitted that there is a serious drug problem, but are those being taken to court who are in big possessions of drugs or those found with one or two doses?
Mrema questioned and said, what is required is to arrest all those who sell and distribute drugs that cause those youth to be found with those small quantities.
how I understood Mrema in this regard is that arresting the youth, who have been affected by drugs and taking them to prison is not the solution, rather it's meeting them and finding a good way to treat them that will enable them to stop the usage of those drugs.
he said a drug user being sent to prison is not the solution because when a person starts using these drugs it is difficult to stop just like that, he needs education and treatment to cope with the situation.
he said if the police are arresting drug users the place to put them is not in jail but they are supposed to start treatment at a special facility.
in Mrema's details, if you send a drug addict to prison, he will be worried because he will not be able to get the drugs anymore, so it is best to deal with cartels that bring them.
he advised when the youth are arrested, be sent to Mwananyamala Hospital, Temeke or Muhimbili where there are specialized centers for the treatment.
in Mrema's performance models, I have now begun to understand that his main goal is not to have many people in prison but to control through education and listening to youth groups including Bodaboda operators and ensuring that those who meet the criteria for staying there are being released.
that is why Chairman Mrema has made efforts to meet those groups and listen to them and give advice to the concerned, activists and the whole community with an aim of ensuring that there are no new criminals being taken to prison.
let us remember that the Parole is a legal procedure that gives a prisoner who has served four years in jail and above an opportunity to serve in the community on special terms.
but due to lack of money, prisoners in prison who should go and finish their sentences outside, are not released, therefore they add to the congestion in the prison.
that parole chairman is fighting in order to ensure offenses that take people to prison reduce and not increase.
that is why in recent days, Mrema visited the Bishop of the church of mountain of fire assemblies of God, Mikocheni B, Getrude Lwakatare and thanked her for the good she had done to release 78 prison inmates by paying 25 million shillings for them.
Mrema asked to have many people like Doctor Lwakatare, in order to reduce congestion in prisons.
according to the parole law, for a prisoner to be released from prison, parole officers must go to take a copy of the judgment in the court that judged him, and then meet the village or estate leaders where the prisoner will go to live and also meet the family and the people he offended.
also, parole officers are required to supervise and visit the parole prisoners, a long process and without completion, the prisoner cannot be released.
the lack of funding to complete the process, prisoners who have qualifications for release by the law, cannot be released and thus continue to suffer in prison.
citizens we should support the Parole Board Chairman, Mrema to reduce the congestion of prisoners in prison.
Kikwete is pleased with the good results of the Stars, he wants them to win the World Cup in 2014
President Jakaya Kikwete has called for the National team players (Taifa Stars) to ensure they win to play in the final World Cup final in 2014 in Brazil.
President Kikwete met with the Stars team he provided for lunch yesterday, the capital of Dar es Salaam.
Kikwete said he was pleased with the good results of the Stars, which won second place in Group C position, and that Tanzanians now love it after doing well in the previous matches.
there was a moment when it was lost and made some fans go into the stadium carrying the bookmarks of best looser, with ridiculous words.
some stopped going and some cheered at the opposing team, Kikwete said.
there was a time I was thinking of even stopping paying the National Team coach and leaving the role to TFF, but I saw a coach die starving and proceeding with the original decision.
I am happy to see now there is a great success, but we should make sure we train ourselves to 'wrap' all the teams in this second round, he added.
he explained that the day in which Tanzania was defeated by Mozambique in the central stadium, he had a difficult time answering the question of President Kagame of Rwanda who wanted to know the results of the match.
"defeat is very frustrating even to us who follow the games, ensure you give us comfort and I am ready to help everything," said Kikwete praising the Opereshi Victory committee for a great task of giving the players attention by giving them Shilling 30 million.
initially, acting chairman of the victory operation, Ramadhan Dau, who is the chief executive officer of NSSF, said their main role is to eliminate all the annoyances of the players and team officials so that they can play soccer in a good environment.
national team Captain Juma Kaseja thanked Kikwete for his contribution and promised to do well in all the matches and qualify.
team coach, Kim Poulsen, said that although they face a great deal of work, they are confident that they will be champions in the World Cup, CHAN and the African Nations Cup (AFCON).

November 21, 2016 by our news writer
Dar es Salaam, Tanzania
the National Economic Empowerment Council (NEEC) has instructed a cell phone company in the country to implement the monetary law of the year 2016 that wants to start registration and ownership of 25 percent of its shares to the public to join Dar es Salaam stock exchange market.
the statement has been given by the acting secretary of the national economic empowerment council (NEEC) Beng'i Issa today in Dar es Salaam during a press meeting.
he has said the aim of the change of the law in the communication sector is to add transparency in the governance of the companies and to increase tax collection to the government.
Beng'i has added that the step will give an opportunity to enable Tanzanians economically to be owners of the companies through buying of shares in the Dar es Salaam stock exchange market.
"cell phone companies in the country are supposed to implement these legal changes within a period of six months starting from the first of July this year to complete legal procedures for stock and capital markets by floating 25 percent of their shares and join the Dar es Salaam stock market so that the citizens can be able to buy shares with a reason of being part of owners of those companies in the country," insisted the acting secretary.
moreover, the acting secretary has called upon all Tanzanians to prepare to participate fully in the buying of shares of the cell companies immediately they complete the procedures of joining the Dar es Salaam stock market.

the national economic empowerment committee requests social preservation organizations in the country to organize a good procedure that will enable those citizens to participate in buying shares of cell phone companies when they join the stock market.
also, it is closely following up the progress of implementation of these legal changes and to ensure its implementation is done in time as stipulated in the monetary law of 2016.

government: we are taking steps of owning coal
by Stella Aron. minister for resources and mineral, Professor Sospeter Muhongo, has said that the government is preparing to take steps of owning all coal ore deposits that are in the country.
the report provided by that ministry has said Professor Muhogo said that in Dar es Salaam yesterday while talking with workers from Sichuan Hongda, a Chinese company.
the workers have visited his office, led by Chinese ambassador in the country, Mister Lu Youqing so that they discus several issues that touches the energy sector in the country, including the Mchuchuma Coal project.
during the discussion, Ambassador Youqing disclosed that, in that project Sichuan Hongda company expects to produce 600 megawatts of electricity, among them, 400 megawatt will be fixed in the national grid by 2018 and 200 megawatts to run the machines.
on his side, Professor Muhongo said all strategic minerals including coal are supposed to be under government's possession so as to govern its extraction and business for the benefit of Tanzanians.
"if all the procedures are complete and the government gains possession of mineral reserves, it will be able to control various problems arising in this sector including the one for the owners of regions with the mineral ore withholding them for a very long time waiting for partnership and other investors to come in or sell them outside the country," he said.
he said that the situation contributes to keen people with an intention of investing in those areas to fail to do so due to lack of space therefore delay development for citizens.
according to that report, Professor Muhongo directed the power company in the country (TANESCO), to discuss with the company so that the project starts immediately.
he added that the project has taken a long time without any success and it is therefore time for Tanzanians to see the project being implemented so that they benefit from its fruits.
"I have also directed TANESCO to hold talks with this company about the construction of infrastructure to transport electricity from Mchuchuma to Mbeya.
"the issue of electricity generation must go in line with betterment of transportation and supply infrastructure in order to get positive results," said Professor Muhongo.
players be good role models in the society
a good mirror of our community, they should not look at the great value they have.
we would love to see our players valuing and respecting themselves together with avoiding things that can destroy their reputations.
same to leaders or other famous people in the country, players are role models, because young children that are growing look at them and desire to be them when they grow up.
the players should know that when they become popular and recognized by the society they get the power and ability to encourage certain behaviors or certain decisions.
some people in the society can copy him for good or even bad things.
a good example is David Beckham of England who there was a time he launched a new hairstyle that many people not only in Kenya, even other countries copied his hairstyle.
several times we have seen the upcoming players imitate dressing styles, shaving and plaiting of their hair from their famous fellows.
those things that players do even just name, people can imitate especially our growing children and those that love games more.
even so it is open that players can cause big changes in our society either to be positive or negative.
therefore, our players when used well as ambassadors of different activities they will encourage positive changes in the society.
a player can start a productive projects from his earning.
these projects must not be concerning sports, he can open a school, start a music company or manufacturing of products.
it is true that sports is entertainment but also part of employment just like there are other types.
the truth is that entertainment does make players
women lead smuggling of gold, tanzanite
it is written by Ikunda Erick
published: 04 September 2016
the government has noted that a large percentage of tanzanite and gold minerals are smuggled by women who wear them in different parts of the body and say it is jewelry so when they go through the inspection machines at the airports it is hard to find out if it is smuggling.
as a result, the government has built itself to control various spheres in the jewelry industry since it has been reported that huge robbery is carried out by them in the shade of jewelry.
this was stated in the evening by the Minister for Energy and Minerals, Professor Sospeter Muhongo while speaking on the 'Tunatekeleza' program being aired by the National Television Center (TBC1).
"you find a woman, dressed in gold, a lot of bracelets and other jewelry, you think she is a gourmet but it is smuggling our minerals abroad, you cannot stop her, we are now planning to deal with the industry, we have discovered the great robbery of these minerals is being done there," said Professor Muhongo.
he said, alongside the government reducing the speed of theft, the problem still continues and that the Tanzania Mineral Audit Agency (TMAA) recently seized 10 tons of minerals being smuggled.
he said government efforts since 2012 have been undertaken to establish benches in the country's airports that monitor and minimize mineral smuggling and since the start of work on these benches have succeeded in controlling large quantities of minerals.
when Professor Muhongo said this, the country's Mineral Commissioner Paul Masanja spoke of the smuggling of the minerals out of the country in different areas and said the amount being smuggled is big.
he said the figures in 2013 show that 80 percent of tanzanite minerals were exported to the country through Panya routes and benefited Kenyan countries which transported and sold tanzanite worth 100 million US dollars.
India also sold tanzanite worth 300 million dollars while Tanzania's producing the minerals got 38 million dollars from exporting the minerals.
speaking of the mining sector as a whole, Professor Muhongo said it was possible in the past that the country made mistakes, but it is good to look at the current situation and then avoid being deceived again.
"we be honest, it is possible that we previously made a mistake on mining, but what we are doing now is to look at where we are now so we do not make mistakes again, we want this sector to generate national revenue by 10 percent from 3.5 percent of the current," he said.
he said the current government is helping Tanzanians who are small miners to be centralized, by enabling modern mining tools to grow their economy and nation rather than relying on big foreign mining companies.
in implementing that, he said on September 15, this year miners will begin being granted equipment up to 200 million shillings for empowering modernization and increase revenue.
regarding electricity supply, Minister Muhongo said in the 2016/17 financial year the domestic budget and foreign donors for rural electrification have reached 1 billion shillings and this is a major step in the revolution in many rural areas.
"we have passed in the Parliamentary budget this year, we have allocated 535.4 billion Tanzanian shillings equivalent to 50 percent increase in REA II, and foreign donors have given us money and total budget for this year of rural electricity is one trillion," he added in implementing a rural electricity project of REA III, the number of people receiving electricity will increase.
regarding the gas industry, he said that 45 to 50 percent of electricity generated in the country is derived from gas, which saved a lot of money that could be used to generate electricity from oil.
he said gas benefits in the country are numerous and that gas consumption in electricity production has helped to alleviate the burden on the public by removing utility services on electrical purchases as well as to new applicants requesting electrical connection for the first time, not paying for the application form.
referring again to changes within the Electricity Company (TANESCO), Professor Muhongo said it must be made a major change in order to move as the Fifth Phase Government.
"I do not want to talk so much about TANESCO, but with its design and performance and as we go it must be marked by a dramatic change, it will be a fast-paced TANESCO, without corruption, robbery, negligence on the way coming," he said.
speaking of oil and gas he said that in order for the country to be a medium-sized economy, the nation depends on the gas and industry economy and to start a Kilwa fertilizer factory in Lindi region in collaboration with the National Development Company (NDC) and your discussions on good steps and stakeholders, including Germany, Denmark and Pakistan.
after completion of its construction, he said on a day producing 3,850 tons of fertilizer and the production would help improve the agricultural sector and thus assist the industry.
Majaliwa discharges 4 forest officials
written by Ikunda Erick, Rufiji
published: 27 September 2016
Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa has suspended four forest officials as well as suspending all activities of the harvest of forest produce in Rufji district at the coast province in order to give way for investigations and putting up firm plans for managing the sector.
these actions were announced yesterday in Rufiji town when the Prime Minister spoke to servants of Rufiji District before later speaking to citizens in his tour of the Coastal Province to inspect development activities and to issue directives to servants in the public sector.
those suspended from work were Head of the Land Department, Natural Resources and Environment, Doctor Paul Ligonja, District Forest Officer, Gaudence Tarimo, Forest Officer, Yonas Nyambua and the Tanzania District Forest Agent (TFS), Suleiman Bulenga.
"effective today, I am suspending these servants and the Ikwiriri gate to be removed immediately, the bush is a thieves haven.
"also all forest harvesting work should stop, there is no harvesting until new procedures and looking at where to harvest, where not to harvest because the forest is depleted and the money going into peoples' pockets, the government does not benefit," said Majaliwa.
in addition, he instructed the District Commissioner, Juma Njwayo to collect all the logs in the forest and to auction them.
he directed the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism to go to Rufiji District to investigate logging licenses that were provided in order to determine those that were legitimate.
"Rufiji has a bad reputation, it leads in the harvesting of forests without following procedure yet there are forest officials, we cannot continue in this way, they should stop work, the ministry will come to inspect and the guileless ones will return, the corrupt the sign is clear you have to go," said the Prime Minister.
Majaliwa is the Member of Parliament for Ruangwa Province and was also once the Rufiji District Commissioner.
he said that the logging had been suspended even for harvesters with legitimate licenses until when investigations were completed and good systems set in place for harvesting for the benefit of the nation.
he said there were administrators who were colluding on forest products by stamping with Kilwa stamps for logs that had been harvested in Rufuji and later pocketing the money.
concerning the Ikwiriri gate, the Prime Minister instructed the Director of that District Council, Rashid Salum to follow-up on orders he issued to the Minister of Natural Resources and Tourism, Professor Jumanne Maghembe when he met with the staff of that ministry.
he said in his orders, he insisted that there was no need for the government to continue having workers without integrity and who are unfaithful to their nation, who have been given responsibilities and they have been unable to implement them by turning their areas of work into their personal benefit.
he added that there was no need of having many barriers of the inspection of forest products, many that have no income and instead he directed that they are reduced so that those few should work with expertness.
earlier, while speaking to citizens at a rally, the prime minster promised to solve various issues affecting the Rufiji citizens which include drug shortage, staff, purchase of a new ferry and promising to provide banking services.
in that meeting, a section of the citizens carried posters with messages of various concerns that the Prime Minister was forced to call upon administrators of the various sectors to answer to those concerns.
earlier, Member of Parliament for Rufiji, Mohammed Mchengerwa, told the Prime Minister that the main concern in the district is the poor discipline of public servants and said many had no integrity.
Mchengerwa said many projects had been squandered, including the Rufiji river basin development authority (RUBADA) and that those who did so are some trusted administrators and given responsibility and asked the prime minister to hold them accountable.
in other developments, the Prime Minister has asked the Rufiji Council's management to ensure that they survey the land and set up plans for better land use in order to ensure that all citizens with sites are issued with title deeds of their sites to be able to use them in requesting loans from financial institutions.

the reader is asking, I loved his money, now I can love him myself?
there are people who find themselves in relationships with people whom they don't love due to various reasons.
in this article, we are trying to show that psychologically, there is a big chance of these people engaging in true love with others if several things happen.
what are these things?
I have got a good question from one of my readers.
the question relates to the content of previous articles.
here I quote:
"how are you a psychologist?
first, a long story.
I was paying for my things in the supermarket today.
and now the cashier looked at my hand (I don't know if he saw the ring?)
he asked, 'sister are you married?'
I told him, yes!
he asks me, "can you be married to someone you don't love completely and after a while you love him?"
I told him, 'yes, maybe what you thought was not true or what was preventing you from loving someone is over or it was superficial.'
I replied to him that way but was surprised (since) he doesn't know me, why should he ask me a question like that?
then I asked him, have you experienced this?
he said, no.
my friend had three lovers and the one she married, she didn't love but her mother loved him.
first he is old!
I asked her, so she married her mother's choice?
she said, yes.
therefore I have reached the end of the railroad.
she laughed, I joked, "old age is the end, Msata, in the city everybody is young, if you have a catch there is no old age in the city.
she laughed and she said it's true that her husband has a lot of money.
the question coming is the one I was asked.
"so can you be married to someone that you don't love then you die and rot later or is it someone loving wealth?"
he concludes his question.
what are the researches saying about relationships?
first is to thank my reader for following the discussions of our blogs and to giving us his opinion.
it's a very comforting thing to see your contribution, I believe other readers will imitate your example to continue with the discussion.
let us go to your question.
like the way lovers love each other today they can find that they hate each other, it's the same way as those who don't love each other today they can find themselves being sincere lovers unexpectedly.
I explained in the previous articles that a relationship has the character of growing in an unexpected environment.
it is like fate this way.
we said, and we are repeating, that when you are in an environment of seeing a person time to time, proximity, step by step, the feelings of loving is created.
and you can find yourself even though from the beginning you thought he is not meant to be, through appearance or character, as you continue seeing him, that's they you continue changing your attitude towards him.
you find yourself rating him as good.
that's why we know people who found themselves marrying people who formerly were killing them.
we mentioned several reasons.
the bigger one is that though the human feature is to love what he understands best, as well it depends on how the person that you meet responds to your emotional expectations.
when he loves you, it is hard to hate him in a normal circumstance, human beings cannot persevere to hate the ones who love us.
when your perspectives are the same, that's how you get attracted to him because human beings love people who look the same.
when he shows that he trusts you, that's the way you continue to love him.
and so on.
how can you love the one who loves you?
now in that environment of getting married to someone you don't love, be it through pleasing others or for reasons that are not emotional like money, it's still very possible to find yourself loving him.
but that depends on the person that you find yourself living with, the way he puts an effort to respond to the needs of your feelings.
you can read here to know which are the major feelings of women.
and so forth, I remind you our debate about the three horns of relationships or love.
we said relationships have three ingredients: feelings of love, intimacy and decisions.
for a relationship that doesn't begin with love, the meaning is that whatever started with our triangle is decision, that is what a person decides to enter into a relationship with a person he doesn't love.
it is like it was in the era of our elders that a girl is caught and finds herself living with a person she doesn't expect.
later the girl finds herself loving the same same person who caught him by force.
that is to say, decision without love is quite capable to be the foundation of intimacy if the one that you married without love he has the capability of responding to your emotional needs like the way we previously explained.
so as he makes you to feel loved, feel you are worth, that's the way the feelings are attracting you to him and creates intimacy.
as intimacy continues, that is when the foundation of feelings of love that was not there previously.
that is to say, if you are married with someone whom did not have feelings for, may it because you loved the money or his status or being forced, still there is a big chance of finding yourself falling in love with like he does, in his position, he will have an earnest effort to recognize and respond to your needs.
but if he is unable to pay the cost of building the relationship with you, as it is normal for most expert men in Swahili, it is very possible for those relationships to continue being mechanical, that is the marriage to remain as an arrangement that will enable you to get money or other needs that are not related to the relationship or love.
maybe if this one who was married to the one she does not love will decide to invest adequately and to make the man see the difference of feelings, differences that will attract him to love her as she expects.
in total, love is a result of peace, perspective and character.
whatever you think is what you get.
and it's not the results of seeing a person correctly like many think.
but if you change your viewpoint and trust completely you can love anybody.

by our writer, Pangani
18 primary school teachers in Maramba division, Mapatano and Mhinduro in Mkinga district, Tanga province have started heeding the governments call that encourages there being local tourism with the aim of growing the important sector for the nation's development.
the teachers visited Saadan National reserve which is in Pangani and Bagamoyo districts where they have learned various things that are about the only reserve that has contact with the sea.
speaking after visiting the reserve, the head teacher of Lugongo primary school Yohana Philemon said the tour has added the teachers enough understanding and that it will help them to give improved teaching of social education.
he said that the tour was scheduled by Saida Ramadhani and Clement Shehiza where he they have thanked the conservationists of the Saadan reserve for the big efforts they put in to ensure that environmental conservation is improved.
moreover, the teachers have asked citizens to develop a tradition of visiting National reserves since it is an important part of increasing understanding of the local tourism sector in the country.
they wanted teachers and the society in general to set aside special time especially during leave to visit tourist spots around their places of residence to grow their understanding of that important sector to the country's development.
he said that the plan to visit tourist attractions has been started by those teachers with the aim of increasing the understanding so that they can teach by correct examples in the subjects that relate to the sector and called on the government to continue improving the teacher's environment so that they can be able to expand the scope of visiting those places.
why women uses their relation with a man as a weapon?
it is common and visible that women are oppressed with men especially when it comes to the issue of faithfulness in love.
moreover, women have also been raped by men whom they are married to, in the sense of forced intercourse without their consent.
in that men also complain that women uses sex as a weapon when wronged by their partners.
when it happens that men make a mistake, women sit silently awaiting be asked for sex so that she can refuse as she uses that opportunity as punishment for the deed done to her.
Hamisi Kizungu says that deeds done by women irritates him, but this irritates him 100 percent.
he says the joy of love when it reaches that your wife should let you but if you made a mistake she should tell you but waiting for the you need her more than explanation then she knocks it down impedes him.
he describes that married when he was 22 year and lasted with his wife for six months because of her behavior of denying him sex whenever she needed something done for her.
he explains that when that woman needed clothes, shoes to travel because she loved traveling, he used to be denied sex and given conditions to gets her what she needed or be left to do whatever she wants.
Kizungu says he persevered and made efforts to be a slave to genuine love, but gave up, "I failed and saw that it shouldn't be a problem, my chicken is in the cage but I'm still required to use rice particles to catch it, I didn't manage so I let her go," says Kizungu.
a residence of Tabata Segerea, Andrew Charles says he is infuriated with his wife's behavior when they disagree a little she climbs the bed with clothes ready to impede him when he wants her.
he says that she will do that for time and whenever it reaches the night he gets hard time during preparations while she refuses and when defeated he decides to leave her and sleep with a clot in his heart.
"when she laughs I look at her because I know if I make a small mistake she puts on again and sometimes pants, she does that even on her mistake, when I tell on her when she is wrong then I should know that day she will show me work sleeping time reaches she prepares herself as if she is going to guard that she is protecting herself from mosquitoes," Charles says as he laughs.
Charles says he is irritated a lot by the behavior of using sex as a weapon and the result of that is destruction of marriage.
"I warned her about sleeping fourth white man whenever she hates and she saw that we sleep one side but she put on clothes and deny me sex," he says.
and Imelda William a residence of Vin gunguti Dar es Salaam city says he has done that way several times before because of lack of what to defend with and the only thing she has and she can be proud of is that.
she says she has been getting short love messages in her husband's phone from other women, whenever she asks there is no reasonable answers that she is given more than being scolded therefore she sees no need of engaging in that act with her husband.
Imelda adds that when they fight with her husband, he utters disrespectful and mocking utterances something that infuriates her and sees no need of having sex with such a person.
"what he does belittles me then after a period of two or three hours he wants me to have sex with him, that cannot happen I am tired of being a sex slave and pleasing him that is why I refuse," she says.
Chiku Mhagama a resident of Kigogo Sambusa Dar es Salaam city says among the reasons that make her use sex as a weapon is lack of what to do whenever her husband irritates her.
she says she cannot give him, she cannot deny her food because he buys it himself, the only thing she can do is not to do with him an act of happiness that is that in order to demonstrate her anger.
she explains that and when she does that, that's when her husband understands that she is angry and even to ask her, "you are mad, that was just a small thing, it is not over, then let it end".
"he do not ask for forgiveness till I deny him sex, whenever he wants he becomes polite and humble, if I give him the rudeness remains there, I use this method to console myself because it makes me proud that I also have something of value," says Chiku.
Chiku explains that she knows the damage caused by doing that including to cause the man to look another lover if he see that annoyance continues and he do have otherwise.
Husna Kibalata says several months ago, she was in the village where she was taken by her husband as a punishment to be taught a fresh because of the love of using that behavior as a weapon.
she says her husband got another woman and he was not keeping it a secret anymore, whenever she denied him, he calls that women and talk to her loudly in front of her and when she could not bear she started a fight that caused her be returned to the elders in the village.
"after two weeks my husband came and explained why he decided to do that way and he wanted my grandmother to take me through the effects of denying a husband sex.
"he asked me forgiveness and said that woman he used to talk to he arranged so as to punish me, and I asked him for for forgiveness and will never repeat even if he irritates me because my marriage nearly got into trouble," says Husna.
psychologist Doctor John Haule says a man and a woman are very different in nature and the primary thing in marriage is to understand those differences in order to live peacefully.
he says despite of availability of those many differences in nature, the major one is that which brings a problem in having sexual intercourse.
he explains that men's sexual arousal is faster than women.
a man can be aroused by just seeing the beauty of a woman while a woman get more influenced sexually by touching and hearing whatever she is hearing from a man.
that way when she hears having told bad things or if she believes whatever was said against her are disrespectful or mocking it becomes difficult for her to engage in that act.
"you can see the population of women that have been affected by lies by men, sometimes reunion as in he lied to her and accomplished but if he arrange words he can lie to her again.
"this results from their feelings of love that are of touching or listening to good words including praising them," says Doctor Haule as he refused to mention the hospital he works at for the claims that he is not a spokesman of that hospital.
Bill Gates an influential and wealthy man in the world who started the foundation (an institution that provides aid) that helps in development activities like medical services, tackling AIDS, improving agriculture, continuing education, and research on sustainable energy.
explains that when he started visiting African villages including Tanzania, he was guessing he ages of the children that he met with.
now and again the children he thought were aged seven or eight years, their true age was 12 or 13 years.
many children are stunted because of lack of proper nutrition.
many Tanzanian children are stunted because of the problem of malnutrition.
they didn't get proper nutrition for a long time, from the time when they were in the mother's womb and the first two years of their lives.
the result, the height of many children is low compared to their age.
many children don't get enough food.
some of them eat and get full, but their food has no good nutrition that satisfies all the needs of a body.
lack of proper nutrition reduces the height of children but also affects the development of the brain, immunity and the development of limbs.
proper nutrition in the first 1,000 days of a child's life, from the time while in his mother's womb until getting to two years, is important in building a child's brain, body immunity, and his limbs.
if a child lacks good nutrition in this period, he cannot learn to do well at school, he becomes sickly now and then because of lack of body immunity and his limbs don't have enough strength compared to a child who got proper nutrition.
children who were stunted, when they become adults and part of the nation's labor, they have a small income in the activities they do.
malnutrition reduces the strength and ability of the nation and extends her people's poverty.
in Tanzania, we have a big problem and of a long period of the stunted growth of children.
in the year 1991, nearly half (49.7 percent) of all children under the age of five years were stunted, very short compared to their ages.
half of the children were not able to build their brains, their limbs and body immunity in the measure the Almighty God willed for them because of lacking food and enough good nutrition.
in the year 2010, twenty years later, 42.5 percent of all children under the age of five still are stunted.
more than three million children of below five years are stunted because of lack of good nutrition.
a moderate economic growth of seven percent every year has not helped much in reducing the problem of lack of good nutrition.
Vietnam had a problem of lack of proper nutrition for children more than even Tanzania.
in the year 1993 in every 100 Vietnamese children, 63 were stunted because of lack of proper nutrition.
when it reached 2010 the percentage of stunted children reduced and reached 23 percent.
even Uganda has done a little better if you compare with Tanzania.
the percentage of stunted children has reduced from 45 percent in the year 1995 and reached 34 percent in the year 2011.
provinces that lead in the stunted growth of children of ages below five years is Dodoma (57.1 percent), Lindi (53.3 percent), Iringa (52 percent), Rukwa (51.4 percent), Mbeya (51.3 percent), Tanga (50 percent), Kigoma (48.2 percent) and Ruvuma (47.4).
provinces that are popular in the production of food especially maize, the big four- Iringa, Rukwa, Mbeya, and Ruvuma are among the provinces with stunted children that is higher than the national average.
the problem of stunted growth is not hunger but to get good nutrition.
provinces with little stunted growth of children are Dar es Salaam (19.7 percent), Mjini West (20.2 percent), Kilimanjaro (27.6 percent), southern Unguja (29.8 percent), southern Pemba (30.7 percent) and Mara (31 percent).
the problem of stunted growth isn't caused by hunger or not being full.
children can get food and be full but they lack good nutrition.
they don't eat foods with protein and enough nutrients.
in order to avoid stunted growth, a pregnant mother is supposed to eat good nutrition so as to give birth to a child with good health.
she should suckle her child for six months first before starting to give him other foods.
to suckle a child on the mother's milk for a period of six months is the best procedure for ensuring a child develops the brain and strengthens his body immunity.
after six months the mother should continue suckling her child, until reaching at least two years and also give him the right food that has nutrients.

teenagers die taking 'selfie' in front of a train in Delhi
the ordeal was reported in the local media
two teenagers died while they were taking photos on a railway in the Indian capital Delhi.
a group of teenagers went to the railway station to take selfie in front of an oncoming train.
but two delayed to leave the railway and the train crashed them, the police said.
a study last year has shown that many deaths have been attributed to people taking selfies in Indians than any other country.
academics from Carnegie Mellon University and Indraprastha Communications Institute in Delhi say that among the 127 deaths of people taking selfie between 2014 and 2015, 76 cases are reported in India.
a recent event has been reported after the media in the area reported on Tuesday.
"during the photo session, they saw the train coming they moved aside.
but another train appeared on the other side and were stranded in the middle.
they were hit by one of the trains," the Indian Express quoted a police officer.
one railway officer has added that the teenagers hired a professional photographer for the job.
"we have found the used camera from the teenagers.
it had photos and videos, the video is being scanned, while those pictures prove that they were jumping from one railway to the other," Deputy police commissioner Parwaiz Ahmed told Hindustan Times.
last year two students drowned as they were taking selfies in a flooded river in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.
and police in Mumbai have mentioned 15 areas where 'it is dangerous' to take a selfie after an 18-year-old girl drowned in the sea while taking a selfie.
183 billions
183/- for special tickets could have bought one Airbus.
November 25, 2015 Raia Mwema in Entertainment and Sports
in the early nineties our country hosted the Iranian president Rafsanjani during his visit.
after being shown around several places of our country, on the day to leave, president Rafsanjan met the media at the airport.
it is normal for journalists to ask, but the most surprising thing that day was when Rafsanjan asked journalists to explain to him why Tanzania is poor while it has so much resources which he himself has seen with his own eyes.
and honestly, if I were there when the question was asked, I could have stretched a finger and said, "your Excellency president, Tanzania has everything, the problem is Tanzanians!" why?
see this example of our neighboring country the Democratic Republic of Congo.
according to The Africa Report magazine, 183 billion shillings for tickets for the elect which president Doctor John Magufuli told Tanzanians that they have been used to buy tickets to travel out of country could have been used to buy one big plane, an Airbus and some change would remain.
according to Africa Report magazine, the 74th issue of October 2015, which I have read, has news on the 56th page that the government of president Joseph Kabila has bought from the airplane company that went bankrupt, Alitalia in Italy one of its big planes, and Airbus A320 at a cost of 50 million American dollars.
the money that our elect have used for tickets to travel out is 183 billion, equivalent to almost 84.1 million American dollars!
yes, Tanzania has everything the problem is Tanzanians! we see that in our country most local problems are contributed by some of those whom we guaranteed leadership lacking patriotic hearts.
they are people who put personal interest first.
this situation has lead to most Tanzanians giving up.
there is a time I received a letter from a Tanzanian who lives in Germany.
this letter really touched me.
I will refer to this letter by putting here the introduction of the relevant letter, then I will say mine.
I quote the author of the letter,
"hello!
my brother Mjengwa,
since my understanding of this rottenness of the Tanzanian government I have been crying everyday although it is hard for tears to come out from a grown-up.
I am hopeful this problems will one day end but I now see myself losing hope.
there is nothing better and as days go by is when corruption grows and the corrupt get born.
I ask myself, is there an end to this? or what am I supposed to do to stop crying? I am in Germany but I am ashamed when I am asked where I come from?" end of quote.
first of all, the author of the letter and all of us are not supposed to see this in the governments image only.
it concerns our actions and our responsibility as citizens who were born in this country.
in his speech to open the 11th parliament, President John Magufuli, apart from other things he mentioned that Tanzania is a rich country.
I also believe that our country is very rich but its people are very poor.
very few are the ones benefiting from the riches of our country.
and we are not supposed to leave that thing continue.
there are our children in Songo Songo whose parents do not have the ability to educate them while where they live there are investors who harvest our gas and make themselves huge profits, and by evading tax.
and there contract for harvesting gas? it is 25 years! a whole quarter a century.
our fellow Tanzanians who participated in this corrupt contracts may not be in the world after the quarter century of the investors extracting and clean out our natural gas.
we have left our resources to be managed by some of our fellow Tanzanians who have the characteristics of a fox.
they are selfish people and lack sympathy on their fellow Tanzanians.
that is why we have been hearing of successive scandals: Rada, Richmond, IPTL, EPA, Eskrow, Meremeta and many others.
they are scandals that make a few to shine while others deteriorate into a pit of poverty.
yes, its base is political discrimination that comes from selfishness and greed for wealth among those whom we sponsored to make big decisions on our behalf.
it is a state of the ones we guaranteed leadership to lose particles of patriotism, love for their country.
they are people who value their interest and of those around them.
they are ready to even use Mafia tactics to meet their objectives.

Facebook is asking for forgiveness from its users.
the social network Facebook has been forced to ask for forgiveness from its users after sending the message about identifying situation after a blast occurred in Lahore, Pakistan.
Facebook through its Safety Check service where, if there's an unsafe occurrence in an area that has internet users, will send messages to inform close relatives the state of the user in that region if they're safe.
after the explosion of the bomb where approximately 70 people lost their lives, Facebook sent a message saying you are safe to people who were far away from that area, "it seems you are in the area affected by explosions in Gulshan-i-Iqbal Park, Lahore, Pakistan.
report to your friends so that they can know that you are safe."
after recognizing that there was a problem, it was necessary to apologize to those who received that message.
unfortunately, a lot of people who had not been affected by the chaos (Pakistan) received the message asking them if they were safe, the problem that has risen was not intentional.
we are working on it very fast so that that problem can be fixed, said the report from Facebook
fish rearing is profitable
while many farmers continued resentment due to crises of production costs, poor pay and bad effects of weather, a great relief for fish farming has budded at Vindimbwini.
that industry has reached the level of bringing 50 billion shillings year per for fish breeders despite having the full agricultural potential estimated to be more than 130 billion shillings.
the cultivation has increased with many of these farmers, saying that it has a lot of benefits since it requires low cost of production.
according to the chairman of the union of small farmers in the country, Mister Leonard Mutugi, this fish industry has raised hopes of many farmers especially those close to sources of water.
"in general, one fish pond can give a farmer a profit of 50,000 shillings in only six months, a situation that cannot be compared with any other crop farming," he said.
Mister Mutugi says that since the launch of fish ponds projects five years ago, many farmers who embraced this farming activity have abandoned the tea and coffee cultivation due to countless challenges experienced there.
"the sweetness of livelihood for the fishing industry is that the government funds the construction of ponds, gives us fingerlings to start us off rearing and then offer us knowledge about the market," he said.
the situation has been incorporating a special unit of the Ministry of Agriculture which promotes the rearing of aquatic animals commonly called aquaculture.
it is in this process that the government through the unit allocated 4 billion shillings which will be spent in the next three years to promote the local fish farming industry.
while addressing fish pond farmers in Kigumo constituency recently, the chief officer of the unit, Mister John Karanja said that currently all the projects have been assessed and are at various stages of implementation.
"that plan is to strengthen the industry which was launched in 2007 by former Minister of Finance, President Uhuru Kenyatta through the program of stimulating the development of the economy (ESP)," he said.
that official says that the funding will target areas without sea or lakes to help local people get involved with the fishing industry saying that challenges that were occasioned by lack of market has been currently resolved and farmers are reaping satisfactory benefits.
he adds that there are currently 48,000 projects, which have been introduced in arid areas where breeders received 20 billion shillings the previous year.
the status of those projects will be expanded to 80,000 projects in 170 constituencies and in general the farmers will be able to earn more than 100 billion shillings if only the local market will be strengthened before considering the export market.
currently it is only three percent of the national capacity that is distributed to commercial fish and the local fish keepers.
if that percentage could reach 30, those farmers can reap reasonable income," he said.
Mister Karanja says that another market that is doing well is that of fingerlings being sold to new breeders.
"at the moment, the fingerling is sold at 7 shillings each.
new farmer should start with 3,000 fingerlings.
that means the farmer can get 21,000 shillings per day," he said.
he said that areas with sea currently benefits national economy to three percent of their capacity, saying that the situation is miserable and without any benefit because most of the fishermen do not pay tax as their strategic market is governed by inadequate ideology.
"there are those who believe that fish should not be sold and what they do is to have sex with their female customers and offer them those fish in exchange.
such measures make fishermen poor and then deprive the national economic wealth that could be gained if the market strategies had been maintained well," he said.
to ensure that the marketing strategies of fish products is maintained, the government will also have to spend 60 million shillings to build a fish factory in Nyeri County to enable local people to increase their yield.
the process is expected to also benefit other fish farmers in the counties of Murang'a, Kirinyaga, Nyandarua, Kiambu and Laikipia.
the chairman of the implementation of the project Mister Michael Kabui says that the plant will benefit more than 1,200 farmers in Nyeri County.
"in addition, the project will employ approximately 30 employees directly and thousands of others will benefit abundantly through the arrangement of the broader market which shall be diverse from the products provided by the factory," he said.
Mister Kabui said that the factory will be able to prepare 15 tons of fish per day.
"the problem that we predict that may occur is less fish to satisfy the mechanical operations of the facility.
it will require fish farmers in nearby areas to work harder in farming," he said.
he wants farmers to increase the number of ponds saying that the factory will have refrigeration equipment to store fish which will be delivered in this manner thereby reducing fish spoilage.
among the challenges that breeders have expressed about aquaculture is an invasion of animals who catch fish, penetration of air poison from the ground into fish ponds and major cost of production.
moreover, those farmers argued that the cold season affects tilapia fish species reared by many farmers.
the ministry of aquaculture development has been instructing farmers to consider types of catfish that are not affected by seasonal changes and also take a shorter time to mature.
Mister Kabui says that these challenges can be controlled if the farmers join a cooperative society that will prepare them for breeding strategies, productivity and penetration into the market.
"currently we have one factory in Othaya area that makes fish provender.
officials accused of selling relief food
by Magdalene Wanja
some of government officials in the Nakuru County have been accused of selling relief food which was required to benefit the poor.
speaking in Nakuru, Njoro Member of Parliament Joseph Kiuna said the government had already provided relief food but some corrupt leaders benefited from selling the food.
"government officials have the responsibility to defend and serve the people, but it is embarrassing that they are benefiting from the help of the poor," Mister Kiuna said.
the area has been affected by Maize Lethal Necrosis Disease (MLND) maize disease which resulted in poor crop yields.
the most affected areas are Njoro where the government continues to provide support to prevent hunger.
initially, some officials from the area demanded that the government establish a program of feeding pupils at school to prevent children from missing school.
Mister Kiuna challenged farmers to promote alternative food farming such as millet and potatoes to prevent hunger.
they are also encouraged to use different types of foods apart from maize to help children get better health.
"there are many schools in this area and their activities can be severely affected if the nutrition program will not start as students will be forced to walk around in search of food," he said.
the nutritional plan for school children is mentioned by researchers on education issues as one way to facilitate the largest number of children to receive education.
communication towers to expand the communication market in the country.
July 31, 2016
it has been explained that the starting of independent companies of phone communication towers, is able to reduce the costs of running cell phone companies in the country.
before that, all cell phone companies in the country, each one was forced to build its own tower which requires a high amount of investment if it's together with generator use, security and other running costs.
that was made clear yesterday by the director of sales and marketing of Helios Towers company, Michael Magambo as he spoke with journalists in Dar es Salaam city.
"that's where independent towers companies come in".
"they own, manage and run the towers, that can be used by many phone companies at the same time and also even television broadcasts, radio, and agents of the condition of the weather," he said.
he said usage of one tower removes the burden of investment costs of infrastructure and other activities in the area of the tower.
he said also, phone companies get space to direct more strength in the areas they are more able to provide voice and 'data' services to Tanzanians.
many don't know our contribution in expanding phone services in Tanzania and Africa in general.
"Helios Towers is a big of independent towers in the country, having built more than 1,000 telecom towers of Tigo Tanzania in the year 2010, then it built 250 other telecom towers and it expects to add other 150 by December this year," said Magambo.
moreover, he said in the past two years, areas of Helios that are jointly used by phone companies is 53 percent for now and is 60 percent of new areas for the whole country while it awaits a guarantee of the government of taking the tower of Vodacom Tanzania.
"we have been hearing critics claiming that a company like Helios has no competitor because they have captured a big market"
this isn't true.
the certainty is that Helios has been strong in the presence of competition in the market of phone services, allowing visitors to enter the market and giving service providers a chance to take services to the villages without worry.
finally, it's the consumers who benefit more, by reduced phone prices and to choose the network that they want.
"the truth is that we are opening the market more," added Magambo.
even so, in reducing the challenges of taking services to the village areas that have no phone services, earlier the government provided a vehicle known as the Universal Communication Action Fund (UCAF) that helps to reduce costs and motivates service providers to go to the market of the villages.
that step came from the Law of Availability of Communication of the year 2006 with the aim of nurturing the development socially and economically in the towns and villages through TEKNOHAMA.
far from that, the company of Helios is on the run to put 27 machines under UCAF.

ways of reducing challenges of house girls.
we have mentioned two items that change the system of upbringing.
first is the change of gender roles defined by society.
when the mother enters the labor market and goes to work as the father is used to, the challenge that comes out is how they can raise their child during working hours.
second is the deterioration of family ties which weakens the help in rearing children that was normal from the next of kin.
these two force modern families to look for other ways of rearing children to give the parents an opportunity to continue with work.
in this article, we look at the service of ladies who are hired to help parents bring up children during working hours, commonly known as 'house girls'.
we highlight ways in which we can reduce the challenges of their services.
ways in which house girls are found
house girls are children or young people who grew up in normal environments, mostly in the village and without much education, who are employed by parents for the purpose of helping them look after the child during working hours.
alongside upbringing, these girls do house work.
normally, these caretakers are found by unstructured means that depends on a familiarity system with family, relatives and friends who can link up the parents in need with the girl seeking employment.
there is no official procedure that enables employers in need to be certain about her history, her skills as well as her behavior in general.
however, it happens sometimes that they are found through familiar people.
although this structure is considered by others as a form of human trafficking, but it has been helping parents be sure and know especially where these children come from.
their work environment
most of the time, these ladies are employed without express contracts and are paid a small amount of money.
however, aside from cash payments, many parents give them allowances such as food, healthcare and other basic services.
their daily routines are usually filled with many activities that do not match their salary.
many of them are usually the first to get up and the last to sleep.
their employers usually have excessive hopes.
in addition to the bulk of work they do, there have been occurrences of these girls being mistreated by their employers in different ways.
there are those who are treated as slaves who do not deserve respect as other human beings.
others are denied their basic rights.
in this environment, these girls sometimes develop inappropriate behaviors that deteriorate their relationships with their employees.
the situation of misunderstanding between the employer and this child servant cause anger, pain and revenge which in most cases end up on the child who is innocent.
their practical upbringing
normally these girls, who in most cases are children, have no experience in upbringing.
the performance of many of them depends on constant direction.
however, in addition to that, still parents with low financial ability usually see them as the answer to the upbringing challenge.
on the other hand, there have been occurrences of these ladies teaching children inappropriate behaviors intentionally or unintentionally.
these, however, most of the time happen to revenge for the feeling of not being treated right.
because the upbringing services through these ladies can be unavoidable to many parents, it is important to discuss how we can reduce the challenges of upbringing that is managed by these girls.
these challenges, to a large extend, that arise from lack of sufficient familiarization in regard to the illicit relations between the employer and the girl.
we recommend the following:
understanding the girl's history
there is need to strive to understand which family the girl comes from, how did she live with her family, her stand, beliefs, at least the basic things.
for these to be possible, it is good to get her through people who know her well.
when you have an opportunity to understand the girl well, you an make correct decisions earlier whether you can stay with her or not.
teach her her responsibilities early
many disagreements between employers and these girls sometimes is contributed by her not understanding her duties as she should.
many employers have huge expectations on these ladies and thus they do not help them to know what they are supposed to do.
it is good once you agree with her that she's living with your family for the purpose of looking after the child, confirm that she understands the entire procedure of work.
if you do that, you reduce the chances of errors that emanate from lack of knowledge of the correct thing to do.
building good relationships with the girl
make the house girl be part of your family.
make her feel loved as another family member.
when you do this, you make her have a cheerful heart and thus have the excitement of responsibility.
for example, you can introduce her to visitors as part of your family and you can consider putting her in an official family photographs that you hang on the wall.
In line with that, avoid unethical relationships with these girls.
when you do that, you create a detestable environment.
when you are loathed, it is easy for your child to be the victim.
give her services that she deserves.
there is no employee who does not wish to get allowances.
even you need that your boss looks at your welfare, and recognize the good work that you are doing.
in the same way, and you think of giving your house girl services that attract her.
create for her a good working environment.
for example, you can think of creating for her a program to further her education.
also, you can make sure that you recognize the work that she does every evening when you come back home.
by doing this you build her desire for work.
show a good example
you cannot expect the house girl to live well with the children when you do not show to care for your own children.
show practically how you expect the child to be cared for.
the girl will learn practically.
also, be an example in doing domestic work the way you expect her to do.
cook, serve food on the table, wash clothes when necessary to show that you're living your expectations.
when you do that, the girl will respect you.
spend enough time with the child
someone who spends more time with your child is the one with a greater chance of investing.
because it is the girl who spends more time with your child, there is a possibility of your child being taught things you do not expect.
it is good to ensure you follow up with your child's behavioral development once you come back home.
strive to speak with your child to determine whether there is any inappropriate thing they have learned.
when you determine if there is, establish their alternative early.
in addition to taking these steps, we do not say that things will be equal.
there can be challenges.
nevertheless, they can reduce.

autism affects Tanzania.
written by our reporter.
published: on 17th October 2016.
Tanzania still faces a major challenge to coping with autism that most people do not treat from not knowing its symptoms, it has been known.
this was stated by the Head of the National Association for People with Autism in Tanzania (NAPA-T), Doctor Stella Rwezaula at a press conference.
"the symptoms of autism have not yet been well known to parents and teachers in the country that they are unable to treat this disease or to get professional help because it is a disease that has a lot of effect on how a person communicates and most often has the tendency to do things repeatedly and unintentionally," he said.
he said for this year, the Lotus Health Center (LHC) which is a non-governmental organization and is working to help children with special needs funded NAPA-T to organize aiming at providing education on autism and this workshop will bring about 100 participants from the private sector and governmental organizations.
he said one of the NAPA-T tasks in collaboration with the LHC is to provide adequate education and training on this disease including local government and the central government.
London Health Center (LHC) executive director, Dialla Kassam said they are proud to work with the National Association for People with Autism in Tanzania (NAPA-T) and thanked the United Kingdom sponsor, Kevin Baskerville who is a professional doctor for autism for his support as he has regularly come to Tanzania to offer training and education on autism.
"through a workshop organized by the LHC last year, the International School of Tanganyika (IST) collaborated with the Msimbazi school of children with special needs and children of Msimbazi Mseto are allowed to go swimming in IST once a week," he said and added that the LHC is making every effort to integrate schools with special needs and government schools.
he said LHC has also been providing support to schools for autism people in Mbuyuni through experts volunteers from all corners of the world and managed by the LHC which also provides educational resources for the school.
he said LHC also works closely with the Muhimbili National Hospital, especially in the psychiatric department to seek donors to establish the first center of people with special needs in the country.
the center will have enough specialists who will handle various psychological problems including autism.
some of the symptoms of autism are failure of a child to look at a person in the eyes, not responding when called, failure to play with children of his age, failure to communicate his fellows, refusal to be carried and embraced, to long to be alone all the time and failure to show or understand different emotions.
another symptom is a tendency to change, to be aggressive, to dislike change, to slow down in talking, to repeat some things, such as nodding the head, handshaking, tiptoeing and moving in circles.
rabbit diseases are few and easy to deal with
by Mwangi Muiruri
according to Miss Lucy Ndung'u who is the assistant manager of rabbit raring farm of Sigona, rabbits are not largely infected by diseases.
it's only caused by exposure to cold environment and also that of diarrhea.
"the right way of avoiding costs of treatment concerning those diseases is just to ensure the environment where the rabbits are kept is not cold or dump," she says.
even so, when faced with infections it is easy to treat them because 50 rabbits will cost you only 70 shillings.
"that is the price of the medicine for destroying those two diseases with one shot.
those medicines are for fighting and countering bacterial attacks causing those diseases," she says.
she says the project of rabbit farming is among the easiest to sustain its cost because even the food is estimated to cost 15 shillings daily for 20 rabbits.
"that is the price of food considering that you will be relieved of the burden of looking for fresh greens from the garden for your rabbits," she says.
other normal danger on rabbits is invasion by flesh eating animals among them are dogs, squirrels, cats and even snakes.
to avoid such dangers, the rabbit shelters must be strong and without spaces that may let those dangerous animals to get in and attack.
the other enemies in the rabbit project are the human beings who like reaping where they did not sow and they may conspire to steal your rabbits.
"solution to that is to be keen on safety of the that project where you may keep cruel dogs, fence round the rabbit shelters and if possible connect that fence to electricity and also install hidden camera the types of CCTV," she says.

Tundu Lissu 'tastes' a hand ball in Singida East.
the Singida East parliamentary aspirant on the Chadema ticket, Tundu Antiphas Mughwai Lissu, has said that he is afraid the general election won't be free and fair claiming that the police force has been prepared to ensure he isn't announced as the winner.
Lissu has said that while talking to journalists in that region where he noted that he has gotten news through the phone from one of the region's bank manager in the city and two police, that the police force has arranged for a great force to reverse the voters decision, so that the CCM aspirant can be announced as the winner.
Tundu Lissu who is Chadema's attorney general, said during different times, he was called by two police officers including FFU, giving him the same information he was given by the bank manager.
he said that those police told him that the police force will use three caravan vehicles (which are used to pour tear gas) and a big group of police and that they've been ordered by their leaders, to ensure that no matter what, him (Tundu) is not announced as the parliamentary winner.
that aspirant said that in a normal mind, the police force should not use too much force in the region of Singida East where since the campaigns began, there has been no incident or signs of breaking the peace.
in another step, Tundu Lissu has promised that if he will be defeated legally, he will agree with the result and he will not have anything to do with it.
but if he will be defeated through dirty methods, he won't agree with those dirty results.
and the police commander of Singida region, ACP Sedoyeka, said they want Lissu because he is a lawyer, to confirm his suspicions, then the police force can take action.
in that state the revolutionary party (CCM) has stopped Mister Jonathan Njau from fighting with Tundu Lissu in this election.
this vaginal discharge is a disease
discharge is a Swahili vocabulary word that means the dirt that comes out of the vagina which isn't normal.
today, I'll answer two questions important to women.
one of our readers asked thus, I am a 22 year old lady, I live in Mwanza, I have a stomach ache problem and the discharge of white thick fluid except it's odorless.
please doctor help me what's the problem, what drug do I use in order to stop it?
answer: I am very sorry, normally the vagina discharges watery whitish fluid which usually is light and white and has no annoying odor, burning/irritating or accompanied by rashes.
its level, together with its appearance, can change in a day due to age.
from your explanations, it means that discharge isn't normal since it's heavy.
that's a sign of vaginal fungus, it can have the appearance like that of fermented milk.
this problem can be treated with anti-fungal drugs that are inserted into the vagina.
I advise, go to a health center near you for diagnostic tests or the risks of that problem to confirm the problem.
question: hello doctor, sorry for the responsibilities.
my wife has been disturbed by a problem of V. discharge for a long time, which normally repeats itself now and again.
she has been given an injection of power safe and Fluconazole tablets whenever this problem comes out, but the problem still repeats itself again.
I am asking for your help please, what medicine can my wife use or what is the way in order to get cured of this problem?
answer: v. discharge means the coming out of dirt from the vagina that isn't normal.
there are many reasons that can cause the discharge, including foreign objects in the vagina like fragments of sanitary pads or cotton, bacterial infection, parasite, fungus or viruses.
bacterial infection now and again is gonorrhea germs, chlamydia, mycoplasma, and parasite usually is trichomonas vaginalis and fungus is candida albicans and virus is herpes simplex.
discharge that is a result of bacterial infection usually has an odor like the smell of fish that is felt after sexual intercourse and can have a gray, green, yellow color or mixed with blood.
if it's a fungal infection, it's like I explained in the first question, parasitical infection, the discharge is usually much and has a bad smell, of a greenish yellowish color and is foamy.
likewise, the bacterial infection can be accompanied by discharge of pus, rashes or wounds, irritation.
from the way you asked and your explanations, it is possible you have a mixture of infections that is, chronic vaginal fungus and bacterial infection or parasite.
I advise you to go to district health centers or local hospitals, since there are special departments for these diseases where appropriate medical guidelines and impurities can be taken for testing and degradation.
of normal.
today I will answer two questions.
may I tell you, that I have found the one who comforts my heart?
I am 22 years old.
there is a young man who we have been lovers even though I don't love him much.
now, I have found another, who I love with all my heart and we plan to get married.
do I tell that first one or do I leave him? through SMS it will be good you tell him that, you've found the flower of your heart so that he stops wasting his time on you because he still loves you.
it is clear that that will hurt him in the heart, but he can hurt even more to hear you are married and you never told him that you found another.
the one of old wants me again, there is a man who we were lovers with, for four years and we had one baby together, even though he left me when I was pregnant with that child.
I have found another, who wants to marry me as the second wife and we love each other very much.
now the father of the baby wants us to reconcile.
advise me.
the condition that the man left at a time when you needed him most having his pregnancy, is a sign that you can't trust him to be your support in times of difficulty.
I have found another, I was married and we got one child.
that child died and after the burial, we disagreed with my husband.
later, he married another wife, but she too they have disagreed.
now my husband wants us to reconcile while already I have found a lover and we love each other very much.
what do I do? through SMS, that will depend on your feeling to him, he cannot claim that you are his wife because he left you and married another.
if you don't want him again and you have decided to be married by another, tell him openly that it's not possible.

these are the bad matters of Tanzanians on phone
Dec 29, 2016
the director of Tanzania Communication Regulatory Authority (TCRA), Innocent Mungy, Tanzania Communication Regulatory Authority (TCRA) has issued a list of bad manners in cell phone use, that many Tanzanians have, Raia Mwema can inform.
at a time the number of Tanzanians who own cell phones continues to increase, bad manners that have effects on the user of those services continue to be worse.
speaking to this newspaper this week, the director of communication of TCRA, Innocent Mungy, said bad manners like insults, using a phone without a limit, using a phone while it's charging and sleeping with a phone are just some of those bad manners.
"another is to believe anything that enters in a phone and taking steps without taking caution, for example, spreading false information".
"finding one's self in fraudulent traps and losing property by being joined in fraud problems or losing money".
not having enough understanding and carefulness in phone usage.
"many phone users don't read the rules and criteria of various uses of communication and many times download various programs and put them in their phones without knowing their benefits and harm".
"to enter into the use of services they don't need, by joining without asking themselves and entering into costs without knowing why they do that and finally to complain that there are high costs of communication".
"also, many phone users have had a habit of forwarding text messages (SMS) or pictures, without ascertaining whether they have morals and are suitable in the community.
"someone you can have major problems by just doing this," said Mungy.
in his interview with this newspaper, Mungy said the behavior on phone use by Tanzanians are not very different from their counterparts in the countries of the East African Community (EAC), but there is a difference with their counterparts from the community of SADC.
"the manners of use of a phone to Tanzanians is not very different from the manners of usage of people of other countries of East Africa".
but there is a possibility that, the manners of phone usage of Tanzanians to be very different from manners of some of the people of SADC countries.
"for example, Tanzanians use their phones for money transactions, whereas use of phone for network money in countries of SADC is minimal and completely lacking in other places.
"usage depends on the level of available services, in various countries together with its cost."
"this causes one country to use some service more than another country".
for example, internet costs and the availability of fast internet in one country, leads many more people to have the habit of using many services that use the internet on their phones.
Mungy said, in recent days, there has been a big increase of phone users complaining of being defrauded through that way and said that is contributed to by lack of carefulness and greed of getting money or property for free.
Tanzanians to be careful to protect important information that concerns their phones if this is together with not giving the number or password of their phones.
furthermore, it's good before joining various gambling games that are played through phone networks, a person must get the correct information from the service providers before subscribing to those games.
also, Tanzanians should abandon the greed for getting money quickly without working.
they should remember easy becomes expensive.
"don't implement any instructions that concerns to sending money in any way, before he satisfactorily ascertains and confirms that the person you're sending to or who gave you those explanations is truly the concerned party," said Mungy.
Tanzania right now is estimated to have approximately 20 million phone users, and Mungy said, there is a big possibility of increased network usage as the service continues to penetrate villages where many Tanzanians live.
why should a sportsperson be clean?
well, readers of this corner, today is the second day since we ushered in 2017, the new year. I would like to wish all readers well in the new year.
today I will explain why a sportsperson must be physically clean.
physical cleanness to a sportsperson is something that is a must due to various reasons including a sportsperson's personal, health-wise, societal and mental (psychological) reasons.
a sportsperson's physical cleanness is one of the fundamental things in preventing getting infections, diseases and bad body odor.
we recognize ourselves on the importance of physical cleanness maybe from the teachings we get since childhood through schools where also we have ever encountered students who appeared to have difficulties with physical cleanness.
we recognize ourselves also in being clean as one of the ways to attract the opposite sex and avoid being alienated or deserted by friends that you will meet as a result of bad body odor.
likewise by recognizing that not being clean is endangering your body health.
therefore then, for the person who doesn't understand this, there is need for him to be educated so as to return to the group.
a sportsperson is a society's mirror. many communities desire to shake the hands of famous sportspeople and greet them closely when they meet them.
training centers and sportspeople's camps are required to be cleaned by using chemicals to kill parasites because many use these areas.
it makes you have a good appearance and therefore making you have self confidence and be alert in sport and even have the excitement to win while participating in sports.
it should be noted that the press releases news in TV, radio and newspapers. having a clean appearance adds value and respect in the society.
physical cleanness gives the society a perspective about your manners, the society mostly prefers people who love themselves.
being clean increases your personality.
despite all that, being clean is an important measure for a human being to be in good health.
unhygienic sportsperson encounters various diseases including skin fungus on the feet, hair and nails.
at the same time, getting skin infections from bacteria including scabies and boils.
the body of a dirty sportsperson is in danger of getting fungus on the private parts, throat infections and bad smell from the mouth and a burning tongue.
as a sportsperson, you should ensure bathing every time you finish playing using clean water and soap. if possible, bath at least thrice a day.
ensure your sports gear, jersey and the tools you use are washed using soap that have accompaniments that are able to destroy disease parasites.
make it a habit to wash your hand with soap every time because your hands touch various areas, and therefore are a source of infections.
bribery brings confusion to parliament Aug 02, 2012
after the Minister of Energy and Minerals, Profesa Sospeter Muhongo and his secretary general, Eliakim Maswi, were saved from being uprooted by a network of the corrupt through members of parliament who are claimed to have been given bribes to fulfill that intention, reports explain that the next coming turn is against the Minister of foreign affairs and international relations, Bernard Membe.
Membe is expected to present his speech in parliament next week, and it is explained that his stand against suspects of the radar purchasing scandal has made him be eagerly awaited by some of the parliamentarians who have also been accused of being given money by corrupt people to press for the dismissal of that minister or even during the debate of his Ministry.
those preparations against Minister Membe are coming at a time when, several sources of news for this newspaper have quoted President Jakaya Kikwete when telling Prime Minister, Mizengo Pinda, that "I am tired of swearing in new ministers," with a meaning that he does not want to lose any minister at the moment.
Kikwete is quoted to issue that statement after the heat of corrupt cartels through parliamentarians tried to remove the Minister of Energy and Minerals, Professor Sospeter and his Secretary Maswi, who are believed to have controlled the siphon pipes of corrupt cartels that were put at Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO).
patriotism struggle vs corruption in the movement of rescuing the ship and controlling the power of corrupt cartels in removal of leaders in the Ministry of Energy and Minerals, some of the ministers, parliamentarians and other special teams that included leaders from CCM headquarters, participated as some of the parliamentarians from the opposition supported those efforts in the Faith of fighting for the interest of the nation.
the reports that reached us explain that the style that was being used was to pass through every time they were passing agents of corruption who, they were seeing members one by one by taking note of a list they had prepared for themselves.
in those efforts, the Minister of Work and Employment, Gaudensia Kabaka, is claimed to have been forced to use pilgrimage transportation at night to pass some of the parliamentarians in order to explain to them the reality of the situation of why new leaders of the Ministry of Energy and Minerals are being fought.
apart from Minister Kabaka, Assistant Minister for Energy and Minerals, Stephen Masele, who is a member of parliament for Shinyanga, has also had a special job of passing whenever he was passing one member of parliament from one of the counties in the region of Arusha (CCM).
it is claimed that that Member of Parliament was spreading money to buy members of parliament to conduct attacks against the leadership of the Ministry, the money that he got from some of the companies had conducted some business with TANESCO in a corrupt manner.
the job was only one, when they are coming from certain hidden after sharing money, we were going to tell the truth and by protecting the interest of the country instead of the interest of a gang of businesspeople who are chewing the country," stated our news source.
the parliament member for Mwibara, Alphaxard Kangi, is also required to walk for several kilometers without using any behicle, coming from one hotel to the other in order to put things right by revealing the truth to those who had been given bribes.
the job was one of the easiest.
it was the job of telling the truth for the interest of the country.
"we were saying the money for bribes had come from who, for what reason and for whose interest and for what objectives especially against the country," stated our news source.
Prime Minister and President Kikwete Reports that reached us are stating that a few days before the heat on corrupt cartels Rose and went to almost getting successful, President Kikwete is said to have called the Prime Minister and told him that he is tired of swearing in new ministers.
that statement was like an order to the Prime Minister, who in his head had the memories of the pressure from members of parliament that caused the new restructuring of the cabinet.
after that, Pinda summoned a session for CCM members of parliament who are in the committee of Parliament for Energy and Minerals.
others who were in that session are, along with the Speaker of Parliament, Anne Makinda, Minister Professor Muhongo and the Permanent Secretary, Maswi.
the session lasted for about six hours.
the situation was volatile and the Prime Minister criticized some members of parliament.
he mentioned the names of those benefitting from TANESCO, who were advocating for leaders who had been suspended from work at TANESCO to be returned.
"two Members of Parliament with special seats exchanged insulting words there.
one told a colleague that he is defending corruption in TANESCO because he is doing business with that company, he too then stood up and answered her that better him who does business with TANESCO rather than his colleague who does the business of selling her body.
Maswi also reminded one of the members of parliament how he once went to ask him for a bribe of 50 million shillings so that he could go and share with his colleagues.
when he told him he did not have that amount of money, he reduced that stake to 20 million shillings.
"evidence of that has been preserved and will be presented to the concerned section," explains our source of information.
Malecela is called to rescue the ship, the former Prime Minister, John Malecela, was forced to serve as well.
Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda is mentioned to ask him to explain to him the real situation of one member of parliament from Arusha so that he can stop to continue being an agent of corrupt cartels who were benefiting from TANESCO.
elder Malecela sat with... member of parliament (the name is mentioned) he explained to him everything but the guy was stubborn.
the elder told him "you are going to finish yourself politically days aren't many," but he continued with his stand, so the elder left him and now his condition politically is bad.
he is part of the parliamentarians who are being accused of corruption," explains our source of information.
the secret of parliamentarians requesting for bribes, secrets of some members of parliament and especially in asking and receiving bribes have continued being displayed by some of them, explaining to Raia Mwema that, most of those who took loans of up to 200 million shillings to start a business, those businesses have died and their salaries now service those loans and for that, they do not have any other source of income.
due to that situation, members of parliament have been crying for increment in salaries and allowances, and through their committees, some are claiming to put pressure to be given seminars by some of the public corporations and institutions.
some of the parliamentarians who spoke with this newspaper under a condition of not being mentioned in the Newspaper, have said that besides the parliamentarians being in that hard situation, there is a government weakness to an extent that parliamentarians are allowed to interfere with the government action activities.
as a result of government as a result of the dollar axis seems overwhelmed by Parliament and thus being too submissive to the parliament, (surrender to Parliament),
the parliament has found its position of managing and advising the government being used badly by entering into small issues of administration and performance on a daily basis.
"they have stopped managing the government on the issues of policies, now they are becoming agents of business people who missed out on tenders or business people whose licenses are being canceled," explains one of the parliamentarians from the lake region.
in adding strength to that argument, another member of parliament says "those who are complaining of being oppressed or in whichever way are supposed to go to court and not to parliamentarians, and again by giving them money".
"most business people who are affected by the decisions of government officials, nowadays they don't go again to court to oppose oppression they think has been done to them, they run to members of parliament in parliament".
another member of parliament from the Southern Highlands mentions that another reason for members of parliament to ask for bribes is the system of electing parliamentarians, which is of a high cost and after the election, citizens who were helping in the campaigns of parliamentarians have been turning members of parliament as sources of their income.
he says members of parliament also take loans to start businesses in order to increase their income, but due to lack of business expertise, those businesses have died and, at the same time, a large section of their salaries is deducted to compensate for the loan.
the Committee on Natural Resources to be dismantled after calling for the Public Accounts Committee led by Kabwe Zitto, Committee of Local Government led by Augustine Mrema and Central Government of John Cheyo to be burned, such as that of Energy and Minerals due to various suspicions of corruption,
a call has now been released to Speaker Makinda to dissolve other parliamentary committees.
those committees include the committee of land, natural resources and environment, the economic and finance committee and the committee of defence, security, and foreign affairs.
the committees of defence and that of economy and finance, are under pressure from some parliamentarians to be dissolved because the chairpersons of those committees already their integrity is being doubted before the citizens.
those committees are led by Member of Parliament for Monduli, Edward Lowassa and that of Economic is led by Andrew Chenge.
Lowassa resigned after being pressurized by the Ninth Parliament as he was connected with a scandal of a complex power regeneration Company of Richmond.
Chenge is regarded as a leader who ensured the controversial purchase radar whose process shook the British parliament.
but when the situation is like that for Lowassa and Chenge, the committee of the lands, which is led by member of parliament for Kahama, James Lembeli, is accused to have been compromised by a group of business people, with claims that at different times the group has paid the members of the committee for the chance to debate the government's decision of preventing the permits for transportation of animals outside the country.
that committee of Lembeli was compromised by those business people at a sitting that took place on Sunday (November 6, 2011), a day that isn't a parliamentary working day.
that seminar took place at the Chambers of Pius Msekwa, in the parliament within Dodoma City.
that committee also is claimed to have once been paid for a seminar hall and allowances for its members by business people of illegal hunting, a seminar that was done at the Saint Gaspar hall, in Dodoma, April this year.
this partnership became sustainable
of course, every good Citizen of our country has been fascinated by the news published in this newspaper yesterday that political parties forming the Union of the People's Constitution, have decided to collaborate in the 2015 Elections by nominating one candidate in the presidency, parliament and the district positions.
the heads of the parties have already agreed to start the process and have drafted proposals and submitted them to their party's secretariat for analysis.
we see this action of the parties that create partnerships as an important step of increasing power in order to enhance competition which is important in the political future of our country and thus supporting other economic and social spheres.
since the release of free politics almost 22 years now, the country has not yet witnessed a genuine competition that can make rulers more accountable to the people in view of the risk of being removed from power by opposition parties.
this is based on parties competitive in politics being encountered by conflicts that have been divisive and thus becoming increasingly vulnerable to elections and thus defeated by the ruling party and its result has been a lot of desperate citizens resulting in a decline in voter participation in the polls year by year due to the lack of competitiveness of competitive politics.
perhaps that is why the citizens have suggested that the Constitutional Change Commission that the parties may be allowed to connect power during elections because they have seen the power of competitive parties, and the rulers will continue to lead in practice and the results are citizens to continue their poverty and see the freedom of the political parties does not help to improve their lives.
it is not our intention to see the ruling party removed from power by competing parties, but what we want to see with a genuine competition, the attention of the truth which, for any nation, is a healthy for the nation as it adds accountability to the rulers.
there is no argument that a strong opposition, pushes the government to work and to serve the citizens by recognizing that if it does a sloppy job it will be removed from power by the shadow government which is the political parties.
opposition agencies fear the state's shadow and weaken the development and stop the hopes of citizens wanting to see government accountability since it is a leaven to promote non-democratic and non-democratic governance in the citizens.
that is why we congratulate East African Community leaders for recognizing the importance of integrating forces into one to put real competition in the political context we have.
what we can advise on the East African Community leaders is to be careful and eliminate distinguishing differences.
the East African Community should not expect that everything will be easy since the major rules that have been violating the opposition activities have not yet been deleted.
it is our hope that the government and the ruling party will adopt the East African Community process as a challenge to maximize efficiency in serving the citizens and not begin to create hatred and seek ways to stop it.
Professor Lipumba claims Maalim Seif is a traitor.
Rashid Mkwinda
explains the reasons for his resignation.
claims he once pursued Doctor Salim to contest in CUF and he refused.
at one time former chairman of the people's party CUF who wrote a resignation letter, Professor Ibrahimu Lipumba has come out and showed clearly that, he once pursued the former Secretary General of the OAU Doctor Salim Ahmed Salim to contest for the presidency of CUF but he refused because he was a faithful member of CCM.
Professor Lipumba made those statements, during a special interview that he did through the power breakfast programme which was being aired by radio clouds FM yesterday morning when he was explaining his reasons for writing a resignation letter and his intention to go back to that party.
he said that in the year 2005 immediately after CCM threw off Doctor Salim, he pursued him to contest for the presidency through CUF and that Doctor Salim refused saying he was a member of CCM and he can't leave that party and join CUF.
Professor Lipumba said that after being asked his reasons for continuing to be the chairman and that he has been contesting for the presidency without giving others in the party a chance, to which he answered that he has been making efforts to look for other people to contest for that position without success and that, party elders have been pressuring him to continue contesting for that position.
furthermore, professor Lipumba pointed out that his secretary general Maalim Seif Hamad has been betraying that party with the intention to kill it in the countryside and that was the exact reason why he decided to write a letter resigning from the chairmanship.
he said that Maalim Seif turned against him and made talks with CHADEMA concerning issues of the unity of the people's constitution without involving him, yet as chairman only he was supposed to be involved in those talks and reach agreements on the process leading to the 2015 general elections.
he showed clearly that what happened between him and Maalim Seif is a betrayal like it happened during the time of Mzee Aboud Jumbe in the year 1984 when as talks went on, one of the people made a betrayal where secrets of the meetings were taken to Mwalimu Nyerere finally Mzee Jumbe decided to resign.
"my secretary general turned against me, at the same time while I was attending meetings, he was doing unofficial meetings, there was sabotage and unfortunately or intentionally, he had talks with CHADEMA leaders, our CHADEMA colleagues used that opening to weaken us," he said
Professor Lipumba, who was being questioned by listeners through short message service and engaged in those questions by commentators, Masoud Ali 'Kipanya' and Barbara Hassan as they led that programme, said that the coming of Edward Lowassa is one of the reasons that made him write a resignation letter.
explaining reasons for his impatience and in that way being forced to write a resignation letter, he said that he was unable to persevere out of the fact that he would be forced to be a campaigner for Lowassa whereas, he openly knows, that contestant was covered with accusations of lacking ethical leadership values.
answering the question if there is proof of Lowassa's involvement in the accusations made against him that can take him to court, professor Lipumba answered that the late Mwalimu Nyerere already said in the past that this young man (Lowassa) has an unexplainable wealth, therefore, it was enough to see him as having accusations to answer on wealth.
even so, he said that he believes that he's still the legitimate chairman of CUF because there has been no meeting that sat to discuss his letter and accepted his resignation, and even so many people reached to ask him to return to his position.
"many people came to ask me to return and I decided to write a letter cancelling my resignation letter and I planned until the day of entering the office to start working, the secretary general wrote to me that I shouldn't return to the office until he had sought legal counsel from the party lawyers," he explained.
"paragraph 117 of the constitution says resignation will be complete, if the appointing authority accepts, the authority which appointed me never met until the general meeting, therefore, cancellation continued to make me continue being the chairman before decisions of the general meeting had been passed," he emphasized.
Professor Lipumba also said that he has no plans of starting any party or joining another party and that he can't allow Lowassa to enter into CUF and that the act of Maalim Seif refusing to shake hands with Doctor Shaine was a mistake and that it's not a civilized act.
furthermore, he made it clear that together with their political differences between him and Maalim Seif, they met with him in the Hindu Mandar hospital, where they met and shook hands even though he had chased Professor Lipumba from the party.
the courts have set special time for 'sugar daddies' case
written by Muhidin Amri, Tunduru.
published on: 17 October 2016
Tunduru district, Ruvuma province has set aside a special time in court to hear cases and issues concerning men who impregnate primary and secondary students.
that was said at the weekend by the District Commissioner Juma Homera while speaking to students and parents of the Masonya Girls' Secondary School at the 11th graduation of form four students of that school.
Homera stated that it is evident the drop in performance among many girls in secondary schools in that district is contributed by the female students engaging in love affairs and thereby failing to concentrate on their studies.
he said, in order to stop this, he urges the court department to conduct cases of suspects charged for impregnating students at the ward level in order to speed up the hearing of the cases by helping the witnesses not to go far as well as avoid case taking a long time as others are completed after the time for graduating from school has already elapsed.
in addition, the district commissioner congratulated the teachers of that school for offering high quality education and enabling the school to lead at the regional level and being among top 100 schools in the nation in the form six examination last year, and he urged the form four students to set a record of ousting the fourth grade.
earlier, welcoming the guest of honor, head of the school, Elice Banda has urged parents to provide their students with all the basic needs in order to avoid being lured to received aid from 'benefactors'.
she said that the school has 533 female students from form one to six, and it is experiencing an accommodation shortage as a result of the dormitories being unable to satisfy their large numbers.

published: 05 October 2016
the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar (SMZ) has said that it is satisfied by the efforts being taken by the Cuban government in strengthening the health sector by training patriot doctors up to the point of providing treatment to the citizens.
this was said by the second Vice President, Ambassador Seif Ali Iddi, while speaking to his host the Vice President of Cuba, Salvador Mesa in his office in Vuga town, Unguja the day before.
Ambassador Iddi said that already the second batch of patriot doctors who had received advanced training on medical profession through the support of the Cuban government had started working and therefore greatly assisted in dealing with the problem of shortage of doctors.
"the contribution of the Cuban government in the health sector is great, first in training patriot doctors and second in bringing in doctors to help in the treatment of citizens of Zanzibar," he explained and requested the Cuban government to help in investment in the sector of the area of deep sea fishing.
the Cuban vice president called on Zanzibar and Cuba to form a team from both sides, that would work on using the deep sea area in promoting economic output.
Cuba was among the countries that supported the Zanzibar Revolution in the year 1964 while helping to provide assistance including provision of high level military training to the first Zanzibari youth who had formed the Zanzibar Liberation Army.
24 begging children escape Kurasini.

published: 27 September 2016.
24 children who were loitering and begging, were gathered by the governor of the region of Dar es Salaam, Paul Makonda and taken to be nurtured in the national children's settlement, Kurasini, have escaped and they are back on the streets.
the officer in charge of the center, Beatrice Lawrance, said that yesterday in Dar es Salaam city when he was talking at the celebration of 21 years of law center and human rights (LHRC).
center officials visited the children who lives there and give various donations.
about children running away, he said in a period of three months in which Makonda has been encouraging cleanness in the city, he took 54 children, who were in the estate like beggars.
among those children, 22 were connected and returned to their families and there are eight children who remain here in the center, and those who escaped many of them have 16 years," said Lawrence adding that far from those children the center has a total of 75 children.
he said those children find a way to escape from the center due to the big challenge of short fences in some areas where sometimes even outsiders can see what is going on in the center.
even that he said those children when they were brought in that center, they were superficial, giving statements of displeasure to be taken there saying they can not stay there.
regarding other challenges of the center, he said the lack of medicine especially when a baby is sick, children's fares when going to school and when coming back, along with wanting solar power due unstable electricity every time.
he said that the government station is the only one in the country that receives children from three years to 18 from different areas in the country, including orphans and those who are in dangerous environments who are found through protection and safety teams from every different municipal council.
regarding the visit by the LHRC stakeholders, he thanked them for the different assistance that was taken to those children and requested other stakeholders to see to the needs of children and to take their time and to join them because it is a group that needs love and a lot of care.
on his side, the Executive Director of LHRC, Doctor Hellen-Kijo Bisamba said they are celebrating 21 years from the time the center was started and for all that time they have been doing different activities of providing legal education, good governance and human rights.
"the center today has visited the home of these children which is part of the celebration with an aim of celebrating together with the children and to continue to encourage the community to protect and to defend their rights, protection and quality welfare of the children in the country" said Doctor Bisimba.
parents take your children to be treated for spinal bifida.
written by Magnus Mahenge.
published: 31st October 2016.
specialist doctors from the orthopedic institute (MOI) have decided to camp in various regions in the country to provide hydrocephalus and spina bifida surgery services.
there is a big problem of children suffering hydrocephalus and spina bifida in the country, due to the fact that a study conducted by the MOI institute in 2002 indicates that approximately 4,800 babies are born with the problem.
it is only one out of eight among them that is 500 to 600 who are taken to hospital for treatment.
due to the magnitude of the problem, those doctors have camped in over 16 regions, where they have performed surgeries in 18 children in Mbeya, 12 in Morogoro, 50 in Mwanza, 14 in Iringa and they have already saved more than 185 children and continuing with these camps and surgical services in other regions.
doctors are offering that service for free, but surprisingly parents with children affected by big heads and open backs, are either illiterate, afraid of the cost or do not want to take the children to see those doctors.
the Executive Director of the institute for orthopedic surgery, brain surgery and atomic surgery (MOI), Doctor Othmani Kiloloma said they have decided to set up those camps near the people to deal with that problem.
together with the efforts of the few doctors about seven in the whole country, six are in MOI and one in Bugando, still, citizens with children with that disease don't want to use that opportunity that brought that service closer, they continue to stall.
the action of the children's parents not to be enthusiastic about this rare opportunity by the doctors bringing that service closer, is what has made me write a thought in order to encourage parents to be enthusiastic about the services that are offered for free.
the parents' lack of enthusiasm towards the opportunity, makes the children continue being disturbed since still, the problems of open backs that are caused by the system of neurological vessels not to work well and big heads is a result of the system of water accumulation in the head to have problems, continue to occur in the country.
parents are urged not to be afraid of taking the children to access these services since, it is a rare and important opportunity to save them, instead of continuing to hide them at home, while that disease is curable.
Chief Executive Officer of MOI, Doctor Kiloloma, urges parents to go get the services in regional hospital centers that provide child care services free of charge, as it is expensive to get such services elsewhere in distant places.
Doctor Kiloloma says, parents with sick children, are wanted to use that opportunity being offered for free because they could not have paid for the treatment cost of about 700,000 shillings to one million shillings.
Communications Officer of GSM Funds, Akhalfan Kiwamba said they recognize the problems of the children and decided to make a donation so that they could be operated on.
they are required to use the sponsorship opportunity by the GSM Fund to reach the camp and access the children services being offered for free.
it is the citizens' responsibility to closely monitor those services and to go to provinces whose programs have not been reached.
they have already set up camps in Mwanza province on April 27th to 30th, Shinyanga on May 2nd to 4th, Singida on May 6th to 8th, Dodoma on 10th to 13th, Morogoro on May 15th to 17th and the program is continuing to Zanzibar.

Chilungo: a writer who lost their eye pupils
by Rashid Mkwinda "what is happening in my feelings right now is how I used to see in the past, has remained to be an everlasting image that will never get lost... it is only an image that has remained in my head that is coming like a cinema, my emotions interprets different colors and atmosphere I saw before becoming blind," Mussa Chilungo (60) starts narrating this ordeal.
Chilungo is a journalist who has currently lost his pupils and light of his eyes, he does not see anything passing in front of him, but what remained are the emotions of sounds and memories going round his head which he uses to interpret in his thoughts according to some of the doors of comprehension he remained with.
the only sense organs old Chilongo uses currently is the mouth, nose, ears and his skin whereas one of his sense organs which is the eyes currently don't have the ability to see and that has been his current weakness, initially, he was healthy with two eyes just like any other human being.
for anyone who knew Old Chilungo before will recognize how skillful and creative he was in his journalism profession especially in the radio station where he used to work, The radio of the council of Ruangwa district which is in Lindi province.
when you meet old Chilungo the first thing you will recognize is his ability to identify the voices of the people he used to work with in different times in different regions in the country, be it his journalism profession or in his service in the government.
he knows a person by name provided he hears his voice ones and that is the only identifying talent that the Almighty God has given him after his eyesight departed him.
Elder Chilungo's record is in his mind and in form of imagery in his brain and thus no one can say who he is, you cannot differentiate his ability from any other person with complete organs and this ability is among the things for which he thanks the Almighty God.
"this is my destiny, I don't blame the Almighty God giving me this disability, I believe that before you die you have not been created and God does not stop creating everyday," says old Chilongo as he explains the greatness of the Almighty God and what he has been destined for.
"the ways I used to pass before I can pass by myself without being led by anyone, my disability does not bar me from doing daily activities although there is a difficulty I go through but in this period of three years of my blindness I have started getting used to," he says.
just like it is a need of most people without any kind of disability, Oldman Chilungo has needs that is compatible with people of that kind but as a result of challenge that met him, he has accepted that situation although unwillingly but it is the actual situation and that is how his life is right now until the end of his life.
"truly before you die you have not been created, I was healthy, looking with two eyes just like you are looking but right now I don't have eyes, I interpret voices in emotions," Oldman Chilungo explains.
Oldman Chilungo who is a father in a family of five children was born in 1953 in the village of Ndekenyela, Ruangwa district in Lindi province got his primary, middle and secondary education between 1969 to 1972 from Lindi secondary school where before that he was in school in the year 1970.
he says that he was among the teachers who were chosen to teach the elderly Lindi town between the year 1973 and later a school of parents community which is in Amani in Dar es Salaam and later in the year 1976 he moved to Mwanza province in Ukerewe district.
"there I taught in Mulutunglu and later went back to Lindi province and chosen to be the head teacher in Nyangamala primary school which I was with for different periods in different schools until the year 2000 when I was appointed to be journalist officer of Ruangwa district council," he says.
Chilungo who is also a husband to one wife who he identified by the name Zainab Liwikila says that he went to study journalism profession in Bagamoyo where he later continued with journalistic work until 2009 when he got blind.
the source of blindness, Mister Chilungo says he does not know the source and the actual problem of his sickness but what he knows is that he started losing sight after a headache, "initially I started seeing darkness, eyes lost energy, I went to CCBRT hospital Dar es Salaam, I was told that I have a problem of blood connecting with the eye I was treated but I did not get better," says Chilungo.
he says that his thoughts shows him different pictures like cinema having different colors which he used to see before he went blind and that together with being in that situation he continued with work until when he retired teaching in the year 2011.
he has managed to build a house after getting blind whereas when he was healthy he never had the ability to build and that it has given him consolation since with the blindness he would have been a liability to the community had he been living in rental houses.
about his journalism work and his cooperation in the community of journalists of Lindi province, it's the representative of the acting committee of the club saying that together with being in that state of eye weakness, he still gets a great cooperation from his fellow journalists of the journalism club of Lindi province and those from Northern provinces.
"I thank all journalists from the Northern provinces who were touched in their hearts by my condition when we met more than 150 journalists in Iringa province, most of them shed tears and donated to me, this unity should be continued to others with problems like mine," he says.
he says that his club leaders including the chairman Abdulaziz Ahmed have been involving him in different activities and seminars that goes through the club without considering his condition.
he clarifies that there are his fellow journalists that give him assistance such as Juma Mweru who helps him in editing and going in the streets to record various programs which he broadcasts on the radio.
"Mapunda and Mweru have been a great help to me in my blind situation, they give me help with work and enable me to sustain my daily work well," he says.
he calls upon other people with disability to accept the state they are in and live like before and that such kind of problems should not be the start of living in dependence where also the government and private institutions should not isolate the physically challenged and to give them priority.
those who do not join NHIF will not get good service.
written by Sifa Lubasi, Dodoma.
published on 03 October 2016.
senior secretary of the Ministry of Health, Public Welfare, Gender, Elderly and Children, Doctor Ulisubisya Mpoki promised not to give free services to hospital workers who do not join (NHIF).
"if the civil servant doesn't have insurance he should pay this amount, do not give free service," he said adding that those service providers shouldn't sabotage the service," he said.
he made that statement yesterday in Dodoma town, when the Managing Director of food and drugs authority (TFDA), Hiiti Sillo was handing over a blood testing machine worth 35 million shillings at the Mirembe hospital.
he said the availability of that machine, will help reduce congestion of patients at the referral hospital in Dodoma region and Benjamin Mkapa.
Tanzania food and drugs authority director, Sillo, said TFDA as well as ensuring quality and safety of food, drugs, cosmetics and medical kits aimed at protecting the health of the citizens, has a system of care and value the community to support development activities.
he said every year they have been offering donations or funding different social groups in the community with an aim of creating and developing good relationship.
he said, in support of President John Magufuli efforts in making sure all citizens are given heath services effectively and at the right time, they have decided to deliver that machine.
Silio said, TFDA in its budget of year 2015/2016, has bought a machine to test blood for 16,500 dollars, equivalent to 35 million shillings.
"TFDA recognizes that the health of a human being is a very important pillar in the development of the country, therefore the machine of testing blood in Mirembe Hospital, we believe it will improve the provision of health services to the community the way it is expected," he said.
the Chief specialist of Mirembe Hospital, Doctor Erasmas Mndeme, said that machine will enable the patients to get the tests on time.
when the patient gets the correct test the doctor will give the correct treatment, we are thankful for that aid, he said.
the revolution of agriculture or agriculture of revolution?
October 30th, 2014.
this article has resulted from the topic I submitted on the commemoration of world food day that was organized by the network of groups of small farmers in Tanzania (MVIWATA) and took place at the ICE hall, Sokoine University (SUA) on October 16th, 2014, under the motto "family agriculture: feeding the world and protecting the environment".
so, will the dream come true?
from the length of the topic itself, I have decided to divide it into three articles which will come out in three continuous weeks.
I really thank you, the network of a group of small farmers in Tanzania for inviting me to submit the topic at these commemorations.
although I was invited on short notice, I agreed to come for two reasons.
the first reason is because I wanted to learn.
I usually learn a lot every time I meet sweat breakers be it in the buses, stones or forums, concerning suffering being caused by the cruel system of modern day liberation, together with the means of combating it.
therefore, my work will be to stir up the topic of debate.
my second reason for coming is that, this week is a special week.
it is a week that the vulnerable from Africa are commemorating the deaths of two prominent people of the fight for the vulnerable.
those are teacher Julius Kambarage Nyerere and Thomas Sankara who was the Burkina Faso leader.
the teacher died on October 14th, 1999.
Sankara was cruelly killed on October 15th, 1987.
these heroes are people who had taken a vow to break down capitalism and dictatorship, together with the institutions that served them.
therefore then, today is also a day to meditate on their thoughts and their fighting strategies so as to use them to advance the fight against this cruel system.
the sages said that "the good do not last"!
this week is also the commemoration of the 70 years of the dummy called World Bank.
this dummy born in 1944 had the responsibility of resurrecting economies in the European countries after being damaged severely during the World War Two, which was started by the dictators themselves.
I don't know who gave it the mandate to be the World Bank.
in his lifetime, Nyerere struggled to kill this worthless thing by claiming a new world economic system (New International Economic Order).
Nyerere's efforts were killed by the then American President Ronald Reagan who rejected the new system.
Sankara wanted the African leaders to unite so as to boycott paying the debts which the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were forcing Africa to pay.
those debts are fraudulent and the finances have been stolen from poor countries.
while addressing the African Union meeting in the year 1987, Sankara said, "we are required to boycott together, so as to prevent being assassinated one by one".
but if Burkina Faso boycotts alone, I will not be here during the next meeting.
and that is what happened.
he was cruelly killed the same year by being betrayed by his assistant, Blaisse Compaore, who was being used by the dictators.
but the struggles by Nyerere and Sankara are not dead.
this week, there are activists gathered in different cities in the world to pray for the death of the World Bank.
they are saying that this bank did not deserve to live for 70 years, and it is about time World Bank died a normal death.
if it will not cease, then at least it should retire forcefully!
so, what wrong has the World Bank done to deserve a death punishment?
yes, it has committed unforgivable sins.
it is this bank, together with IMF that forced poor countries in the world to follow the destructive and looting policies of modern day liberation.
when the boxer gloves become heavy!
May 22nd, 2012
when boxers get into the fighting ring they put on gloves that fit their weight, and normally the boxers challenging one another must have the same weight or their weight measures need to be close.
principles and different guidelines other than the weight, are the referees who are tasked with making decisions as the match continues.
the referee is always in the ring.
thirdly, there are judges sitting at the edge of the ring.
the judges' task is to award the boxer who strikes his competitor on the permitted areas, most notably key points are awarded when a boxer hits the opponent on the face or on the forehead region.
these points, if one of them is not beaten by the so-called "knock-out" strikes, are included to determine the winner.
however, there are some unofficial referees.
the unofficial referees have the same authority as the official referee in the ring.
the unofficial referees are two: one on the red corner and the other one on the blue corner.
in the red corner, we have the coach, assistant coaches and other specialists as well as one of the competing boxers.
likewise, in the blue corner we have the coach, the assistant coaches and other experts as well as one of the boxers.
the unofficial referees are also mandated to give decisions as the match progresses.
their decision can end the match without the official referee's consent.
for example, when the referee on one corner notices that the boxer has been overpowered by the opponent, he throws the towel into the ring and the referee stops the match immediately.
victory goes to the opponent.
an official referee can also save the boxer, but this decision is reached at when the referee sees that one of the boxers has been overpowered in the sense that he cannot stage any defense towards his opponent or the boxer is not in a position to fight against the opponent.
the rules and regulations in the game of boxing make me enjoy the sport, especially when we get to know that your corner can save you from receiving a beating.
founding father of the nation, Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, I think in 1997, when he contributed to the topic of globalization by government officials, in Dodoma, explained that when the rich countries stress on globalization without provisions to help developing countries, is looking down on the poor countries.
he said doing so could be compared to Nyerere participating in a boxing match with Mike Tyson, where the obvious result will be a knock out victory in favor of Tyson!
during that period of the late 1990s, Mike Tyson was the world's heavyweight boxing champion.
many of his opponents in that period were easily knocked out in the first stages of the match.
Mike Tyson often delivered the knock out punch to his opponents before the fourth of the 12 rounds to be played so that the match could be easily end and the judges would add up the points to declare the winner.
the aim of this article was not to discuss the rules and regulations of the sport of boxing, but to use this game for the purpose of understanding the main motive.
this is, in my opinion, that the game of politics is equally exciting and attractive to the audience as the game of boxing!
all games, politics and boxing are enjoyable.
however, in the game of politics, when one is overwhelmed and begins wavering around in the party (your camp), especially in African politics, you will not be rescued from the predicament.
the main goal is to be saved by the opponents camp or party for that matter.
if you stumble and get saved by your opponents towel, then it vividly shows that you joined politics for selfish reasons and you don't have the interests of the people whom you represent at heart.
in a fantasy language, it's just like getting into the politics ring but the gloves you've got are not fitting you well and you are in line to receive the knock out punch.
the gullible behavior is a trait seen in people who do not have the sincere ideology of their faith in promoting the development of majority of the citizens.
another characteristic in African politics is the female politicians, who are many in number, but do not know how to choose a competitor to go against.
it's obvious if you choose to fight with the rich, expect a knock out punch, especially if your heart was not well prepared on the ideology that you firmly believed in which propelled you into thinking that you were ready to defend the rights of the majority.
we have heard, in our own case, politicians say without fear that some of our targeted investors will sign up contracts within the hotel and abroad.
but before the sun has set, the same politicians say: "Tanzanians, be ready to buy stocks from of the countries of the investors who were accused of condemning our leaders to make hotel deals!
we expect 80 percent of Tanzanians to receive help in fighting poverty among those living in rural areas with great distress - their health is poor, majority of their children do not have desks thus they learn while sited on the floor and their hand hoe farming does not give them ability to eat and spare.
today we are sending an alarm and announcing: my brothers, let us invest in buying shares from the mining companies in the country!
do they really know what company shares are?
or are we just talking to the rich who live in the city, especially the city of Dar es Salaam?
we could help these rural Tanzanians by encouraging them that after the harvest season, percentage of the sales revenue should be directed towards getting into a contract with rural shops so as to expand the capital market in the rural areas.
law enforcement agencies can help them write such contracts for a little fee.
we are not speaking of corporate agreements, the meaning is different, and we do not target the SACCOS, but the contract allows a person to be given a percentage of shares as part of his capital.
they might not be many people.
but with a contract that is well clear and the sales records are well documented, they will clearly know how much the profit is and now the sharing will be done based on each person's capital.
people like this can slowly grow in stature and eventually afford to buy work machines such as tractors which will open up employment to others.
for that reason, the rural residents are in turn amassing their wealth slowly and steadily.
but motivating such citizens to buy shares sold in dollars from foreign owned companies, isn't politics that brings development of many voters, rather it's politics of self-seeking for fame on television, newspapers, and radio.
if there are such politicians, they should be called leather sandals because they are here nor there. (flip - flop).
the term staggering in politics is widely used in the election campaigns in those countries that practice the type of politics where they compete on ideologies, policies and planning on how to manage key issues.
for example, in 2001, I saw on CNN television, a report of the debate by aspiring politicians for the Prime Minister's seat in Australia.
in the debate, the the Liberal Party's candidate, John Howard, spent much time accusing his opponent, saying that Kim Beasley party was unfit to lead the country because he is known to flip-flop.
the issue that was used by Mister Howard to accuse his opponent of being a flip-flop like a sandal concerned how to deal with refugees.
while continuing with the campaign, a ship was seized while in the high seas with approximately 200 refugees from the country of Afghanistan.
before the ship was seized, it experienced problems and the lives of people were put at a risk.
those problems are what caused the ship's captains to ask for assistance, that caused their arrest.
without that problem, they wanted to sneak in silently.
Mister Howard stood firm on the point that even though the ship encountered difficulties, they would not be allowed to step into the country because they were entering into the country illegally.
so, he wanted them to be sent back to their country.
his opponent said that because they experienced problems, for humanity's sake be allowed to enter Australia and taken to the refugees camps and each one of them to be individually investigated rather than judging them as a group.
Mister Howard got a chance to use his opponent's response as being too lenient and a flip-flop, because the law of the country states that illegal refugees should not be allowed to enter.
in the election, Mister Howard got a big victory in what we the Tanzanians call a landslide victory.
he said he would win, but the victory over the nation has come from many of his countrymen to see him with a solid stand for managing basic issues.
for our colleagues, a sophisticated politician has no chance.
the issue that the politicians of our poorest countries have is, in some cases, the same as the gluttony of the collision, is a disappointing answer.
I do not remember exactly what year exactly, but between 2001 and 2003, a politician said some of the contents of the election campaign that gave them the victory would not be implemented.
to our colleagues where the slightest slip of the tongue may cost them victory, the feedback that some of the issues you advocated for during campaigns cannot be implemented is same as saying you have given yourselves slime chances of winning in the next election or you may be restrained until you resign even before the election.
our colleagues' answers are constructive.
if there was any issue in the case with the candidate that at the time it was not implemented, the response to the people is to say that the issue is now being deferred and we will initiate or address it after three years.
after three years, it is probable that the elections would have been done and you may have won or failed, and thus find time to again reflect on an alternative policy to what you said cannot be implemented.
for example, I have read online that the current Australian government has entered into power and one of its main policies was to handle, getting into power, to reduce the impact of rising gas emissions from industrial.
they promised that even if other developed countries have failed to reduce global climate change problems, especially in the warming of industrialized countries by providing high-speed air conditioning, they (Australia) will give industries to meet standards.
and Australia will be a model and other developed countries in this regard.
however, the government, being polluted, has said that the policy will not be implemented at the moment unless it is postponed until three years.
before concluding this article, let's look at the blueprint saying you do not wear the shoe you do not know what it's like.
if you are not a politician why are you discussing politics?
many Tanzanian politicians have a very good answer to such a question.
their answer is: leave politics to us, or if you want, then join the arena we contest!
it is true that African politics do not know what they are like, how to distinguish between the poor and the poor in the rural areas against the few rich and foreign investors.
and let's finish this article by looking at what we learned.
the main issue is to keep off politics for personal goals, especially for the purposes of self-enrichment.
this is what we have compared to wearing gloves that fit the weight of your ideology and what you want majority of the citizens to devote and contribute towards their development and the country at large.
secondly, we have learned that when we become politicians we shouldn't be flip-flops like leather sandals.
thirdly, we as the politicians we should not respond to questions for the sake of it or sentiments that reduce the excitement of the people.
responsibilities like this policy or this issue will not be implemented in the future.
reader, reflect!
the lack of great national plans causes small individual plans.
May 06th, 2015.
I have discussed for a long time now, the importance of a country to recognize, believe, value and respect itself so as to have nationalism attributes.
among the attributes that make a country a nation is together with having its culture that is recognized by the locals of the country and also visitors visiting or coming into the country through various ways.
I have given several examples indicating that not every country is a nation and it's not every nation that has a country.
additionally, I have given an opinion that even though we had started building nationalism in our country, we slipped somewhere and got off the line and until now we are struggling not knowing if we are a nation or not.
the reasons are known to some of us, but the predicament we have right now is the way to fight them.
the single big reason is the big leadership shortage amongst us.
when I talk of leadership, I don't mean just political leadership but also leadership in other important arenas inside the society.
for sure, leadership doesn't have to accompany the government authority.
in my own meaning, there are people who are not in the government at all, but are society leaders, whereas there are people with big authority but are not leaders in the least.
a leader is one who shows the way.
for this meaning, a leader goes before the others showing them where it is safe for them to go through or which way will get them to the place they want to go to.
many times, this is a route he has already investigated and studied and therefore understands it completely.
a leader can arise to lead the society in avoiding the disasters of diseases.
he can lead the society in innovating new methods of farming, breeding, business et cetera.
there are many ways of leadership that do not require a person to be in governance.
but there is also leadership that accompanies governance, and that is the leadership that many people know of but they wrong it.
a person who happens to be handed authority in the society but lags behind leaving those he should lead to go before him is not a leader, he will mostly be just an administrator, or an officer, or the office overseer.
leadership is more than an office.
by bad luck, for approximately 30 years, our country has had a leadership deficit especially in governance.
the country has been under governors who have no leadership vision.
saying this isn't despising those who found themselves in positions that were required to be of leadership, but they found themselves making them governance ones only.
saying so is admitting that our environment has really changed, and those we put in authority do not have enough recognition of how the environment changed and therefore they do not possess enough understanding of what to do in these environments that changed.
this situation would not have happened if our people (that is to say, ourselves) had enough understanding of what has happened, what has changed, how much has changed, how we have been affected by those changes and what we could be required to do to combat those changes.
every group of administrators that came to power has been coming in with various attractive sentiments with slogans invented in a hurry without deep reflections, and without involving the citizens in any meaningful reflection far from the fanatical happiness and excitement more and not thoughts.
we have heard and read about every slogan released by politicians who have not explained them in depth.
their different types of fans with objectives that are not clear have been repeating those sentiments until they strained, lost power and became heavy on the tongues.
who remembers "the new wish"?
and that is just one of the sayings.
because there is a leadership vacuum, it has been impossible to bring together Tanzanians to discuss and plan their future.
it has been impossible to even conduct an evaluation of whatever transpired in the life of our country.
it's like we start afresh every time, we don't have memories and let bygones be bygones.
the seventh section is found in people not believing in themselves and thinking that they will be viewed as incapable if they listen to other people's advice.
but the truth is that, it is people who have great capacity that are able to get, to take and to use advice.
people who don't believe in themselves can't be able to use advice, even where the advice is available without sweating.
I have no doubt in my intention that, the building of our future has no choice but to be planned.
if it is not planned for, then the country will get out of control, as it seems to be going.
this is because where there is no known plan, everyone does what they know and they can.
culture, custom, tradition and change Jun 28, 2012
in matters affecting development efforts, and sometimes to cut them short and return them back is culture, tradition, and oral tradition.
culture has often been described to be a social or national example, a community's spirit and a source of general guidance to the relevant people.
the complexity of the concept of culture is emerging in many aspects, and not always in the involved community can agree on what is in line with their culture and what does not fit them.
often what is called a culture can be shown to be a matter of being brought in for some interest and is not skeptical in the tradition of the community.
in addition, what can be accepted as a part of social tradition of tomorrow may have changed and seemingly inappropriate.
it is also true that the class of administrators and capitalists greatly affect cultural attitudes by making their thoughts, their desires and their interests to be cultural pillars without any degree of reference that reflect to the traditions for a long time to the extend of gaining approval.
there are things that every time I look at them, I hear, I read, I ask myself questions.
for example, there was a time when this country was confronted with a campaign to ban short women's clothing.
it was forbidden for a girl to wear short gowns or skirts and walk on the road.
union of the youth of the ruling party had the task of moving across the city to arrest girls with short clothes and it became a reality.
big conferences were held, which were addressed by senior national leaders and several directions are given about how to dress.
even the tourists who came down from the plane were tied scandals so that they could cover their parts not to be seen publicly.
it was a breakthrough period.
the disadvantages we experienced in that ignorance were certainly a lot.
one thing is that some people who wanted to visit Tanzania changed their plans and went elsewhere.
in the years of rabbi I met a woman from Cape Verde in Paris.
when she was told that I came from Tanzania she was happy to express gratitude and praise our country for its support in the liberation movement of her country, Cape Verde, I was feeling happy.
she immediately said words that discouraged me: but, with a strong political stand in support of our movements, your people are very backward.
I came with our party leader, of PAIGC (the party for the liberation of Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde).
we arrive at Dar es Salaam airport, we have dropped off the plane, and immediately I am surrounded by the women wishing to dress me and let my feet not appear!
I refused and got a sharp controversy until the head of the caravan ordered me to wear the piece of cloth.
it bothered me very much because my legs are good, not to be hidden.
I vowed not to return to Tanzania, though I was so impressed by Mwalimu's position of redemption.
we came to be good friends, but he did not hesitate to make fun of me on a regular basis about the story.
I am telling this story because we realized that what we were doing at that time was not very important, though we were told that we were guarding "the culture of our country."
later this thing made me ask myself a lot about our focus in thoughts and actions.
in one of the things that came to me at once, each time I passed through the field I was met with women who went on with their daily activities dressed in very short dresses, and most of them were letting their breasts hang without worry.
I recalled that African mother's breast is not a part of sexual passion at all, but it is her baby's restaurant, and the restaurant does not need to be hidden by coverings.
prohibitions on short dresses and bans on public exposure of breasts is a teaching brought by foreigners who, when they came to us, their culture forbid a woman to show her heels and breasts were, in fact, the secret of the husband.
that was a culture called "Victorian" because it was experienced under the reign of the British Queen Victoria.
Victoria's fashion has made the African culture a mockery and is another sign that we have been mentally and psychologically imprisoned.
such scenes are too many.
but, in our creativity, we went far beyond the teachings we received from Victoria's representatives.
if not creativity, if you think that we banned, not only short dresses but also bell-bottoms and Pecos which were not banned during the reign of Victoria Falls because they did not occur in those days.
the Pecos also has a little story.
five years before the "Pecos" emerged in the city, teenagers began to wear pants that were tight from the waist downwards till you wondered how the pants are worn and stripped.
it's just as if a person was sewed into trousers and on the day to take it off it will have to be cut with scissors.
youths of the party went into action looking for young people dressed in "massacre" trousers and it became a difficult task.
young people wearing against "our culture" were stopped on the way and were forced to show that a bottle of beer could pass through the mouth of pants, otherwise they were "shattered."
this activity was terminated only when Mwalimu Nyerere rebuked it calling it foolishness.
in a private conversation he said: "if you were a youth you would stop me.
you want to pass one bottle.
I would have made the pants to pass five bottles, and then see what you will do."
after five years, it came to "Pecos", as did Mwalimu predict.
if it was true that short clothes were forbidden by the teachings of Victoria agents, "Pecos" was forbidden from whose teachings?
no one.
what has been done is to prevent we are not used to because we are not sure and it can be dangerous to us and to our lives we are used to.
anyone who read "Kusadikika" (Shaaban Robert) knows how Karama's biggest opposition to his country has been to want to embark on an unprecedented profession in the country.
that is the situation described as "Conservative", a perspective that doubts any kind of change, wanting to store things as they are and how they were made.
it is a situation that has severely damaged our country and will continue to hurt us until we get a daunting generation trying something new.
well, there are things to be kept and every community and every country has something it likes and desires it to continue.
there are traditions that promote gentleness, generosity, love, honesty and avoiding frauds, lies, contentions, cruelty, laziness, greed, spirituality and so on.
of course, the prohibition of bad behavior has the importance of being kept.
bad behavior need to be banned, even if they begin to be deteriorated among us.
there is no meaningful culture in which you call for evil deeds.
as the community increasingly acquires academic development and opens up the eyes, that's how evil behavior is increasingly beaten, frustrated and eventually abandoned.
some changes of this kind are seen as they occur in front of our eyes, but we often find it difficult to recognize them.
it comes from our homes, it is happening in the offices, we see them on the street, we hear them in parliament.
culture is changing but we are reluctant to recognize these changes.
we are reluctant to recognize it especially when we have an objection that does not accept fundamental changes.
failure of important agenda 2015 March 08, 2013
data analysis on success rates mentioned recently by Prime Minister, Mizengo Pinda shows that average pass mark for those who started secondary in the third phase is 89 percent.
67, while those who started in the fourth phase is 58 percent.
83.
these statistics are for a period of three years during the reign of President Benjamin Mkapa in the third phase of his leadership.
what is considered in the data analysis is the students who started secondary during the concerned leader's term.
during press conference with the journalists in his office at Magogoni, in Dar es Salaam, the Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda said that in the year 2005, the success rate was 89 percent.
3. in the year 2006, it was 89 percent.
12 and in the year 2007, it was 90 percent.
6.
he continued to explain that in the year 2008, the success rate was 83 percent.
6. in the year 2009 the rate was 72 percent.
5. in the year 2010 the rate is 50 percent.
4. in the year 2011, the rate became 53 percent.
6 while last year level of success was 34 percent.
5.
those who started secondary during the time of Mkapa, the statistics illustrate that in the year 2005 the rate of success was 89 percent.
3, those graduates started their secondary education in the year 2002, at the time when Benjamin Mkapa had started his second term.
although the graduates who graduated form four in the year 2006, meant that they started their education in the year 2003, at the time Mkapa was still in power and their rate of success was 89.
12, while those who graduated in the year 2007, rate of success was 90 percent.
6, started secondary in the year 2004, one year before Mkapa retired.
for the year 2008, the graduates started secondary in the year 2005 when there was handing over power between Mkapa and Kikwete, at the end of that year, the examination results for the 2008 graduates had a success rate of 83.
6.
those who started education at the time of Kikwete, the success results indicate that the graduates of the year 2009 whose rate of success was 72.5 percent, started secondary in the year 2006 and graduates of the year 2009 whose average rate of success was 50.4 percent started education in the year 2007.
for the graduates of the year 2011 there average success was 53 percent.
6 those who started education in the year 2008, while those graduates who broke the record of failure, had an average pass of 34 percent.
5 those who started secondary in the year 2009, one year before Kikwete started the second phase of his term.
the heavy work for Kikwete due to how the situation is right now and especially when compared to his predecessor, Benjamin Mkapa, it is obvious that he has a big job of appropriately using almost three years to produce form four graduates who will paralyze the heat of failure, otherwise, the education agenda will be a difficult dice for the future contestant of his party- the party of the revolution (CCM).
apparently, on the other hand the truth of the matter indicates that the effects of failure was more pronounced during Kikwete's reign due to some level of complacency brought about by the then Mkapa's Minister of Education Joseph Mungai, who interfered with the education curriculum by removing some subjects and mixing up others thereby giving rise to graduates who later on became teachers without having been taught some of the subjects that were removed and later on reintroduced, immediately after Kikwete ascended to power.
however, more blame is on Kikwete due to government's failure to invest in basic areas to improve education and instead invested more in education infrastructure.
for example, information shows that during his reign it is as if the department of school audit was dead.
that department is considered dead because of other reasons, among them is lack of sustainable budget, although some auditors also claimed to have lacked required level of professionalism to audit, which also involves assessment of teachers' abilities to teach accordingly alongside other criteria that need to be considered in the delivery quality education.
another area that the government seams to be joking is in failure to adequately invest in the curriculum section, our news sources reveal that a huge need dominates in that area, the system of publication of books has been turned into an exhibition of sorts for ordinary items that are substandard.
"nearly all areas that are said to be important pillars in the betterment of education have been neglected and money is not allocated, yet people are surprised for poor results," our news source explained, from the Ministry of education and Vocational Training, which is currently headed by Doctor Shukuru Kawambwa.
therefore, the great task that Kikwete has whose results of "board of failure" constituted by Prime Minister Pinda can be a guide, is together with ensuring that within two years of yielding graduates before completion of his term, increases the average success rate better than his predecessor Mkapa.
a huge political agenda of 2015 is education which in CCM is like a political dice for the former Prime Minister, Edward Lowassa that can become a big agenda during the 2015 general elections, which has already been predicated to be marred by debates.
if education will continue being an important agenda, Lowassa can have an influence of its kind among members of CCM, although experience shows that, the CCM candidate carries the aspiration of the party's manifesto and not his own declarations, though implementation of that manifesto relies upon his unwavering will.
yet there is no other candidate among those running for presidency on CCM who can dissociate himself from the issue of education.
already Samuel Sitta who to a great extend differs politically with Lowassa, has been banking his political campaigns on managing corruption and poor utilization of national resources.
nevertheless, outside CCM, if this is how things will turn in regards to education being an important agenda, then the party of NCCR-Revolution through its chairman, James Mbatia (parliamentarian) can enhance its popularity at political platforms although it will also depend on the manner in which the party can strategically plan to continue being a source of innovation about this agenda of education.
all the same, apart from NCCR through Mbatia, already the Party of Democracy and Development (Chadema) through its campaigns of the year 2010 declared to improve education in the country and some of its policies is to offer better education and make it compulsory from primary school up to form six.
it is from this situation, that analysts believe education can become an important political agenda in the campaigns of 2015 general election.
TTCL will have to move to GSM.
it is written by Fadhili Akida, Morogoro.
published 14 September 2016.
the communication network for all (UCSAF) wants the mobile company in the country (TTCL) to change its system of communication from CDMA to GSM.
that step is to simplify the availability of communication to citizens of the villages that are in the park of Ngerengere, Morogoro that uses the company's tower that is in Tununguu Sub-county.
the CDMA communication system denies the user's ability in deciding to choose different kinds of mobile and agree to use only one type of mobile that allows the system, instead of GSM that is used to any kind of mobile.
chairman of the board of that fund, Doctor Joseph Kilongola, said the package has provided funding subsidies to that company to enable to build that tower for the purpose of giving the citizens who live in that place an opportunity to get the communication.
he said it would be meaningful as the system used by that company is affecting those citizens tin getting the communication and that is not the purpose of the government.
"place like this TTCL thinking now about the rabidly change of their communication so that the citizens can benefit with the fruit of UCSAF" he said.
the contact tower of TTCL in the Tununguo sub-county, Morogoro distributes communication to the villages of Dete, Mbogo, Kisanga Stendi an Tununguo.
board members of the fund there are in tour inspection projects for the contact towers located in the counties of Tununguo, Chakwale, Chanjale, Chagongwe, Mandege, Doma and Lyogwe that exists in various district in the Morogoro region to see the performance of that tower that is donated subsidies with UCSAF.

speaker, his deputy accept corrections
November 14, 2013
the speaker of the parliament of the Union Republic of Tanzania Anne Makinda, and deputy speaker Job Ndugai, this week on Monday were accused by Ludewa member parliament Deo Filikunjombe who is the vice chairperson of the permanent committee of the government's account and public organizations.
Filikunjombe has reported that those parliament executive leaders have at some point been interrupting the working of that committee not only for the parliament but also for the nation generally.
it is an important committee because it is supposed to do its work on behalf of all the Tanzanians though through the parliament's authority.
on our side we don't want to be on the list of those who will confirm the accusation that the speaker and his vice have been interrupting the working of that committee.
however, we believe that if this is how the situation is or even if the situation is not that way, it is wiser for those parliamentary great leaders to either reproach themselves or remain in the appropriate leadership behaviors, and especially when considered the famous saying that, what is spoken of is, and if it is not, it is coming.
we advice those executive members of parliament at all times to recognize that parliament is a crucial tool for the purpose of citizens and so parliamentary committees are also for the purposes of the all the citizens and are not to be interfered with.
why should a committee be interfered with yet its functions are done according to structures, principles and laws of the country?
we recognize that these committees can be given advice so that they can carry out their responsibilities more successfully but the point to emphasize here is that that advice should not be not be given in a forceful manner.
it will be remembered in September this year, almost two months ago, Tanzania was a native of the committee of public accounts from the countries ministries residents of the South African development community (SADC), a meeting that praised Tanzania in the handling of the relevant committee, inside the parliament in the country.
that's why we advice the parliament leaders to fix themselves early enough when they are corrected by their voters, who are the members of parliament on behalf of all the citizens.
the parliamentary committee that heads the government's accounts and its institutions and even all other organizations are better left free to perform their responsibilities, because on average the committees are taking up their responsibilities well and so the dignity and respect of the Tanzanian parliament grows.

Tucta now invents new tactics to compete for employers
Kigoma/Kahama
organization of independent workers union of Tanzania (Tucta) has asked the Government to put in place laws to revoke registrations of employers who prevent their employees from joining that organization for the fear of being prompted for the interest of those workers.
organizer for this year's Labor Day Celebration (First May), Mussa Mhagama recently said that there are organizations of big companies such as the cotton plucking, oil processing, industries, dispensaries and health facilities whose employees are not coming out to join the organization.
"let me request leaders of workers unions to get into those areas to register workers, and an employer who will refuse, Government to intervene including revoking the registration for conducting his activities," said Mhagama.

4 teachers fall victims of the love affairs.
written by Veronica Mheta, Longido.
published on: 25th October 2016.
four teachers of Kitumbeine Secondary School in Longido district, Arusha province have been suspended from work to pave way for investigation after being suspected to indulge in love affairs their students.
delivering a statement to the Arusha Provincial Commissioner, Mrisho Gambo who is in that province for a five-day tour to assess development and challenges, the District Commissioner of Longido, Daniel Chongolo said that investigations are currently underway to determine how those teachers got involved in love relations with their students.
Chongolo said that once the investigations are complete and ascertained, disciplinary actions will be taken against them.
he also said that there is a challenge of early pregnancy, that some of their parents and guardians have been marrying them off as a result of traditions.
he said that the government is following closely parents with that behavior of marrying off their children at a small age since that problem is at 13 percent in pastoral communities.
nevertheless, he said that early pregnancy have reduced from six in the year 2013 to four although there is still the challenge of girls being married off at an early age by their parents.
"we are undertaking investigations to ascertain whether the teachers truly got involved in love affairs with their students or not and if it's proven about that, harsh disciplinary measures will be done," he said without mentioning the names of the concerned individuals.
furthermore, he said that the district has a shortage of 128 classroom infrastructures, 281 teachers' quarters, 393 pit latrines and 1320 desks, where in this financial year 2016/17, the district has been required to construct 60 classrooms, seven teachers' quarters together with adding six primary schools so as to reduce the problem.
after Gambo received that report, he took part in the roof construction of Longido Secondary School's dormitory that was burnt down.
he requested the police to do regular patrols at the school so as to manage fire menace and improve security of the students, and students to also cooperate with the teachers so as to enhance security during evening classes.
he insisted that the government is pursuing all those who participated in the act of burning the various schools in the region so as to arraign them to the state organs.
he advised village leaders to ensure they participate in planning security in their areas in order to control various incidences that breach the peace including the issue of fire.
slavery 'by choice' is coming May 31, 2012
now let's prepare to witness our children, running to slavery in the thousands.
parents and close brothers of African youth are required to be ready psychologically, to confront the loss of those youth who will soon leave to take themselves into slavery by choice.
where are they going?
not elsewhere, but there in America, where were taken millions of Africans who were sold there like beasts of burden, Africans who are the ones who built America's great wealth.
now America has a black president, whose victory has been celebrated so much by Africa and the whole world in general.
now, this black president wants volunteers, especially black, to go and help him fight in wars that American youth themselves are absconding, like this of Afghanistan.
America says, now that any youth who isn't an American citizen who wants citizenship, will be given citizenship in six months, just six months, provided that he be ready to join the American army to go fight Afghanistan and elsewhere where things have gone from bad to worse.
this procedure had never been done since the end of the Vietnam war, which, from its ferociousness, needed youth from many countries in the world, especially from the third world, and who volunteered and were bribed with the gift of citizenship.
this news, without a doubt, will contain a taste of Bongo flavor for our youth who pass saying, "rather a dog in Europe than a villager in Bongo."
they will migrate to America, again in large numbers, not just because they have been called to go there but also because this country doesn't appear to know what it wants to do with its youth.
they have been left to sprout like weeds in a deserted place.
hope has not been cultivated in their future lives and it's true that they can believe that it's better to be a slave in Europe than to be "free" in Africa.
that's the story from everywhere in the African continent that show, like in Senegal, where the youth are saying if it's dying let them die, but there is no remaining in Africa, and their mothers agree with them!
now I should say - I shouldn't say, who should say?
researchers reminded their responsibilities
10th November 2013
researchers have been advised to have a right way of giving research outcome in order to deal with challenges of different communicable diseases in Africa and anywhere else in order to build a strong community that will speed up development.
the development shall be built through citizens with good health and their ability to get involved in economic activities daily.
the call has been given at the end of the week by the acting director of the institute of Southern Africa Center for Infectious Disease Surveillance (SACIDS), Mark Rweyemamu in Kilimo university (SUA) in Morogoro province while closing a two days conference on the research and communication that brings together several researchers from (SACIDS).
SACIDS is a union of 25 institutions in five countries in the North of Sahara desert to deal with the issue of health together with the principle that collectively involves human and animals, as well as the environment, in cooperation with eight Southern institutions.
Rweyemamu said that researches are building knowledge and witness that must be presented to people such as government servants, non-governmental organizations and the society collectively so as to make sure that the citizens are protected against different kinds of illnesses.
"this two day's workshop has aimed at connecting skilled researchers so that in unity, they talk in clarity among themselves together with the other people who target them," he said.
"those taking part in the workshop include professors, research doctors, graduates and other professionals in research issues from Tanzania, Zambia and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
the workshop was provided by SACIDS in partnership with the institutes of London International Development Center, University of London," added Rweyemamu.
in short, the program was a presentation on how researchers can be able to work with the media, followed by the exercise of action that was provided by the acting executive editor of Tanzania Standard Newspaper (TSN), Gabriel Nderumaki.
Justin Musumu, participant from DRC during the workshop said, "these teachings have helped me know important principles of communication, particularly proper use of English language.
I wish it was going on," he said.
Aaron Mweene, another participant from Zambia added that, 'integrity and having a focused perspective are important things in eloquent communication.
participants came out of that workshop with renewed strength and self-belief of having the ability to build positive systems of communication in their institutions at home where they come from.
they stressed on writing short sentences, using social networks to present various research findings, to work with the media often and putting information about their research in simple language in order to meet the need of the of the people they target.
it is the children and the brother of the leaders of CCM only who remained to fight for life and death
I have been following the trends of the political leaders of CCM with their children together with their other people who are genetically close and to witness that when you leave the leaders on their own of CCM, the second group does anything possible to try and rescue that party is for the children of those leaders.
a lot of children of the leaders of CCM, mainly on WhatsApp groups and Social media are fighting life and death to save their parents' sustenance.
their main game that they are using is to show the public that the opposition is not worthy by, "Lowassa is corrupt person"
a lot of them have no understanding, they have very little capability of reasoning which is associated with being confused and the arguments they create during the confrontations are very surprising.
you will not believe the answers, the competition and their arguments when you meet with them and try to explain that where we have reached there is need for change!
their argument has a lot of anger and symbolizes that they are entitled to the destiny of Tanzania.
readers report, critique and demand rights.
Ndimara Tegambwage
happy new year, readers of this column.
by these greetings, I bring to you the opinions of your three fellow readers who wrote to me.
enjoy reading them through meditation.
one gives a report, the second one builds a topic on human rights and the third one corrects what this newspaper erred in, in his view.
this is what I promised at the beginning of this column, that some of the important opinions of the readers will be published in length so as to promote understanding, provoke debates and urge those concerned to take action.
save the life of this woman: one reader has requested me to invite those concerned to go save one woman whose husband has locked her up for more than three years now, she's in pain and she has started becoming pale.
isn't this the work of journalists?
things are happening silently without you unearthing and exposing them, you especially in your column.
"there are those who will continue suffering and even die," she explains.
community editor, now that is the report to you and the invitation.
there's a guy who has locked his wife indoors and she's sick.
it is more than three years.
she's emaciated to just bones.
the person's looks are destroyed.
"it pains to see her," she writes through a text message.
as neighbors we have tried to give reports in different areas but there is none found to help her.
there is no action that has been taken up to today (28th December, 2016).
this woman is in a bad state.
her husband (she mentions his name) is a retired director from the ministry and the woman suffering and exploited was a servant in the court.
"the husband doesn't even want the wife's siblings to come and assist their sibling," explains the phone number's owner that sent the message.
"I am sure of what I am talking of.
these are my neighbors.
there's a time I was even giving them milk from sympathy.
journalists, make noise to save this woman's life," explains the reporter.
the reporter has requested not to have her phone number in the newspaper. "but if you are coming with police and administrators, use that number to reach me so that we go and rescue this woman's life.
it is here in Wazo, Kinondoni village, Dar es Salaam.
the rights of Ngorongoro residents: editor, please discuss the right to live in equality on the legal front for the community living inside Ngorongoro Conservancy especially after being denied the right to land and agriculture.
the right to live is the most important one among all human rights.
this right is referenced under section 14 of the constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania.
the right to live has been recognized also in the international rights for citizenship and politics.
the violation of this right is together with the continuation of the existence of a ban on farming inside Ngorongoro conservancy.
the ban on subsistence farming has caused difficulties in lives and deaths.
read about Professor Issa Shivji and Wilbert Kapinga (1998).
in their book, Maasai rights in Ngorongoro Conservation Area, they write that denying Ngorongoro locals the right to farm is violating their basic right to live.
the 1975 reforms on the Ngorongoro Conservancy laws are the ones which banned farming inside the conservancy something that violates the basic right to live.
the result of the denial of this right is the presence of hunger, malnutrition among children as it has ever been verified among 29 children from Ngorongoro admitted in Endulen Hospital with one of them dying.
community editor, I would also like you to discuss the conservation law that violates the country's constitution, the international agreement for economic, societal and cultural rights of the year 1966 and the African agreement on human rights and people rights of the year 1981.
Supeet Kimarari, Ngorongoro, 0764949482, Morogoro is not an archdiocese: since when did Morogoro diocese become an archdiocese and Bishop Telesphory Mkude become an archbishop (Citizen, 26th December 2016, page 4)?
you shouldn't mislead readers.
the archdioceses of the Catholic church in the country are Dar es Salaam, Songea, Tabora, Mwanza, Arusha and Dodoma.
their heads are the ones referred to as archbishops.
in Morogoro, it is Morogoro diocese led by Bishop Telesphory Mkude.
this one is under the archdiocese of Dar es Salaam that is led by the Archbishop Polycarp Cardinal Pengo.

did Shilole's Nuh Mziwanda copy from Nick Cannon and Mariah Carey their tattoo?
he has gotten an example!
Bongo Flava artist Nuh Mziwanda shocked many after drawing on himself a tattoo of his lover's name 'Shilole', a tattoo that is permanent.
something that shocked many people.
"I have done this out of my own will, I have not been forced by anyone.
I have felt like doing this because I love Shilole so much...
it is fine if we separate but I will stay with it up to when I go to the grave."
Nuh told the times FM website.
however, Shilole said she wont tattoo herself because Nuh has done it and that she is grateful for his decision because he was not forced and it is a sign of true love, different from what she has ever experienced before.
"I cannot say I will do that because of anything else but only love and when I will decide to do that, I will do just like he has done. honestly, he has true love different from the men I was with, people just like to hear they are going out with ShiShi in search of a kick but Nuh as Nuh has his own unique love. it gets to a point I even wonder where he was. they say when God wants to give you something he does not write you a letter." Nuh Mziwanda's decision is in line with Nick Cannon and Mariah Carey's decision in 2008 when they drew permanent tattoos on their bodies after getting married.
Nick wrote 'Mariah' on his back, and Mariah drew a butterfly bellow her back and wrote in small wordings 'Mrs Cannon',
"to me rings are special and attractive, but a tattoo is more than anything.
they are for ever and ever..." said Mariah Carey.
right now Mariah and Nick Cannon have separated and according to reliable sources they are only waiting for divorce.
but they have tattoo marks for their lifetime that will never be erased forever even when they will have other lovers.
however, tattoo can not mean much like their twins who are a great attachment in their lives.
to what step will Nuh Mziwanda and Shilole get?
will they last like the tattoo of Nuh Mziwanda or they will melt and leave each other with written marks and!
we wish them all the best.
proper diet is a basis of family development, nation
proper diet is an important matter for the workforce of any nation.
the government has a bigger opportunity to make sure it increases the enforcement of proper diet so as to annihilate all kinds of malnutrition in the country.
in order to win this war, you need cooperation of all stakeholders who will implement their responsibility.
the partnership for nutrition (Panita), primary and private schools, religious institutions and public agencies together with local and international companies are important stakeholders in implementing this.
the government is supposed to establish policies and programs that will enhance availability of proper and affordable food from household or family level.
this is together with encouraging production of food crops to have enough food reserves in national silos as well as a good system for preserving, distributing and processing the food.
also, the government should set up an environment to increase employment and income to the citizens, to develop infrastructure and electricity, to control the increase in food prices and to add supplements for example vitamins and minerals in foods.
to add on that, the government should create a friendly environment for small scale farmers to access loans so that they can contribute to production.
people who are in risky groups such as street children, the old and the poor to get services of free food.
proper diet is a cure.
the government should invest enough in the education of proper diet from family level.
citizens should have the capacity of how to serve the sick especially preparation of their food.
besides that, the government should encourage citizens to protect themselves against illnesses in several ways including encouraging breastfeeding for at least six months as well as educating mothers about proper means of stopping the child from breastfeeding.
the government, through its institutions and ministries, oversees the the safety and quality of industrial, industrial and market industries.
it should keep encouraging and making sure availability of enough vaccinations for all children, drinking of clean and safe water and considering body hygiene and the cleanliness of the environment.
despite building and employing experts, parents or guardians should be advised to take children to dispensaries or health centers immediately they fall sick.
it is supposed also to improve health services including availability of health information and education.
the government should set up an equal environment and equal opportunities for all children to be registered and complete schooling at least primary education.
more effort should be directed to girls most of whom are cut short from schooling as a result of various reasons including pregnancy and underage marriages.
divisional schools should be improved so that they become real saviors for children from poor families.
the efforts of president John Magufuli's government of providing free education are to be supported by all Tanzanian citizens and more energy should be directed to communities that do not respond to educational calls.
moreover, education program for the elderly should be insisted so as to involve those who missed while young.

how to plan when thinking of breaking up with your lover
last week in this article we saw that to start a relationship is not an easy thing and it is a process with many challenges.
also ending it is not an easy thing and it has a series of hills and slopes and many people it troubles them and to regret they are making a bad decision that leads into bad results or planting a seed of destruction in future.
it is indisputable truth that it is not a must or by force for everyone entering also in a relationship you end up living together in life (here I mean those who are still not married).
relationship starts and also dies, again for many different reasons including the lovers' lack knowledge of the best way to relate with each other.
the level of investment, hardness or ease of ending a current relationship can be brought by the level of investment that you did with your partner.
if you have invested more in a relationship there is a big possibility to have hardness in breaking off or accepting to leave each other but if have invested little then it is easy to allow or accept that chance of separating when it comes up.
this investment is not only in the field of economy but also in emotions, socially, spiritually and other areas.
you may have met for only a short time, but there are many development things you have done together.
these things mostly your heart hesitates to permit them to get lost easily, you'll find that you try by all means in order to save your relationship and to continue what you did together.
investing in family is when you allow your relationship known by many people starting from siblings to friends, when a storms comes that is cause your separation, when you think of many people who know you and respect your relationship, you see that it is best you try hard to save the boat.
all these and many others situations that can enable you to know how investing in a relationship can ease or bring hardness the time of breaking up.
the level of lack of satisfaction as one of them or all who are in a relationship are not satisfied by happiness, enjoyment, and love that each one of you gets from the other then there is an ease of separation more than those who are satisfied with their relationships.
it is possible a severe storm has hit your relationship but the truth is that, if both of you are satisfied with the way you love each other, in this situation you can sit down and decide to talk about that matter in order to save your union.
contrary, if you are in a relationship and the heart of one of you is hurting every time and there nothing to be happy about, then anything that happens even if it is a small storm can cause your separation.
the level of our satisfaction in the relationship that we are in is what can hold us together for the moment or all the time.
the Evaluation of Benefits and Loss often the difficulty or difficulty of termination or affiliation can be relied on by each of you assessing the benefits or losses of your disagreement.
suppose one or all of you see that your break up has a big loss than a benefit, then there is a big possibility that you all will have genuine efforts in saving your relationship from breaking.
suppose you see or desire to end your relationship there are more benefits for you all or one of you sees that when you separate he will benefit more than getting loses then he will try hard how he can to ensure you are separated.
if not for trying hard then there will be no excitement to engage in any trying hard to save your love because for him death of that relationship have more benefits than continuing.
some of the things that can do a person to see that ending a relationship has loses includes having children, wealth, respect of the marriage, to be respected or to be known by the the society, aging and so on.
the speaker's wife demands police to release him.
by Richard Munguti
Missus Caroline Wangari Gachema, wife to the Speaker of the Embu County Parliament, yesterday filed a case at the Nairobi High Court requesting that the police be ordered to explain the whereabouts of her husband who disappeared on May 19th.
Missus Gachema explained in the case that she had filed that her husband Mister Justus Kariuki Mate disappeared from a luxurious tourist hotel while attending a conference and his whereabouts are unknown.
it is alleged he had a phone call from a police officer.
he left his phones at the meeting hall.
while this was going on, leaders in Embu County led by Senator Lenny Kivuti, Members of Parliament Cecily Mbarire (Runyenjes), Mister Muriuki Njagagwa (Mbeere North), Women Representative Missus Rose Mitaru made an urgent prayer service at the High Court in Milimani, Nairobi.
the service was led by Missus Mbarire and attended by representatives of various wards in Embu County.
"we believe Mister Mate was abducted and is being detained.
the government has the ability to look for Mister Mate's whereabouts.
Embu county has been beset by leadership problems, and just recently when we buried 40 people who had died after consuming poisoned alcohol," said Mister Kivuti.
Mister Kivut said, "we want Mister Mate's current whereabouts revealed.
we want him now.
the government has the power unearthing him from where he was taken."
members of parliament, Mitaru, Mbarire, and Njagagwa were saddened by events in the county and said, "we will not continue this way, things must be fixed."
"in the case that she had filed at the High Court Missus Gachemi has accused David Kimaiyo the Inspector General of Police, the Director of the Criminal Department (DCID) Ndegwa Muhoro and the Administrator of the Intelligence Unit in Nairobi's Starehe area."
avoid bhang because it is harmful research
despite the presence of many studies proving the effects of bhang on the health of a human being, the efforts of wanting the usage of that product to be legalized continue to increase speed in various places in the world.
the neighboring country of Tanzania is the most recent to be seized by the pressure of legalizing bhang after many states in America allowed their civilians to smoke bhang.
villagers in Makete district, Njombe province South West of Tanzania want the government to put a law that will legalize the use of that plant.
the claims of those villagers that from long ago, they have been using bhang seeds to fry their food without witnessing any health effects is a distorted thought.
research that lasted for a prolonged time has proven that the youths who smoke bhang harm their minds, and may lose comprehension and the ability to remember.
according to health experts, the youth who began using bhang while under the age of twenty years exhibit very bad results in examinations and demonstrate a major deficiency in their minds.
one international body, that did a research on bhang usage, discovered that youth who began using bhang while aged below 18 years when their minds had not matured, lost their ability to understand things quickly.
an expert on those issues in the country of England said, perhaps that research, explained why people who use bhang have no ability to understand things easily.
apart from being a nation that established itself economically and in many social sectors, America gives a distorted view of bhang usage.
Washington is the second state in America to legalize bhang after Colorado, where that state claims to get millions of dollars every month from imposing a tax on bhang businesses for those who use it for entertainment.
America's step give the governments of developing nations a hard time to control the farming, business, and usage of bhang because users have many needs and the price is high as compared to other produce.
there is a need for leaders and health experts to provide strong a strong argument and of science to oppose bhang usage because similar to marriage between people of the same sex, possibly the campaign to legalize bhang usage may spread in Africa.
the painful truth is that bhang is a drug that is highly used.
according to a statement by the United Nations on narcotic drugs in 2013, bhang usage has continued to grow in the world starting from 2009 while the average usage in the world is four percent.
it's clear that governments that decided to legalize bhang, have removed for themselves the heavy burden of struggle against a type of crime, but it's important to understand that the intoxication of bhang doesn't destroy only health but it also increases the cost of public health and crime.
recent research has shown that Tetrahydrocannabinol, a chemical that is found in bhang can easily penetrate the oily wall that protects brain cells and affect brain cells.
by considering this, without a doubt bhang is harmful and awareness should be increased.

DNA shows that Sonko is not the father to a child in Kwale
by Farouk Mwabege
investigation from the government laboratory has determined that Nairobi Senator, Mister Mike Sonko is not the biological father of a child he is being claimed to have given birth to with one woman from Kwale County.
this was determined yesterday in a case where one woman has presented a case against the senator claiming that Mister Sonko to be forced to care for a child she is claiming to have given birth to with him.
a report of the government laboratory in Mombasa, which was signed by Mister George Ogunda was presented in the court yesterday and explained that the child is not Sonko's.
however, complainant's lawyer, Mister Leonard Shimaka strongly opposed the results of that investigation.
before the Resident Magistrate of Kwale, Miss Christine Njagi, Mister Shimaka said that the investigation was not in an appropriate manner.
"validity of these results would have been determined only if the children's mother would have been completely involved in that exercise," said Mister Shimaka.
that lawyer revealed that the Senator took those children when they had come from school and went with them in one hotel in Mombasa town where the exercise took place.
he said that the situation is a doubted one especially when it is considered that it is only one child who was examined by a private doctor.
these results have doubts.
therefore, it is my request that exercise be repeated afresh for us to save time for this court," said Mister Shimaka.
he recommended that the exercise be done afresh at Path Care hospital in Mombasa town and all involved parties to be involved.
"integrity of Path Care hospital is of high standard and the results shall be submitted directly to this court, said the lawyer.
that lawyer also submitted a request which required the Senator to continue taking care of those children by buying them food worth 15,000 shillings every month at Nakumatt shop in Ukunda area and also to pay for their school fees until when that shall conclude.
the senator's lawyer, Miss Lydiah Kwamboka agreed to that request but strongly opposed claims that the DNA investigations were done in an invalid manner.
"that investigation took place in the hospital and considered all important criteria," said Missus Kwamboka.
that case will be heard on December 17.

CCM Mwanza still battling Aug 11, 2012
the conflict involving the chairman of the committee of Misungwi district and his party CCM, has taken a new turn now as expressed that he has refused to resign as had been called to following that the removal is related to the upcoming election battle for the party chairman in the province.
news received by 'Raia Mwema' newspaper says that the chairman of that committee Bernard Polycarp has defied the command of his party at the district and provincial level that wants him to resign as the chairman of the committee because he was associated with abuse of the committee's funds as part of working on the strategy of his group approaching the elections of the CCM party chairman in the province.
the source of news inside that party has explained that there is a tough tug-of war in contesting for the post between the current chairman Clement Mabina and one veteran who was once a holder of many political positions and the government including being a minister is supported by Polycarp.
"the situation in the party is complex.
it has been affected a great deal by the conflict over camps that are scrambling for party chairmanship in the coming elections.
even this situation of the chairman of the Misungwi committee has already been grabbed and put into campaign.
it is now part of the agenda for soliciting for votes" explained our source.
it is explained that the chairman has refused to respect the terms of the party to resign from the position in the committee to give the chairman of the party hard time, whose camp believes that the decisions of the party were influenced by fear of the current chairman's inability to defend his position and therefore to reduce the power of the opponents camp.
but when chairman Mabina himself was asked about that state he expressed that the party's stand remains regardless of the accusations those who are defending themselves use and the party won't wave.
when he was asked about the emphasize of taking a step against the chairman whether it had a personal agenda politically, particularly to protect his position so as to reduce the power of fellow contestants politically, he said whatever he did was to stand firm for the party and not to protect extravagant people.
"I don't care what they say.
but even if it is being a chairman I cannot be a chairman in a province with extravagance.
if workers governed by the party will be of this kind I better not be a chairman," said Mabina.
he insisted that his and his colleague's work is to stand for the party's constitution and if there are any who think that doing that is carrying a personal agenda against his opponents politically, then it is better they do not elect him.
"in building a stable party we must get to a point of taking decisions that not everyone will be pleased with.
if you want to please everyone you might fail to lead, and if the party makes decisions I stand with them without care if they will vote me or not," he insisted.
when he was talking about the requirement for him to resign from his party if it had any relationship with elections, Polycarp said he is scared to look like he is wrestling with his chairpersons because that might confuse the party members, something that will be out of order in the party.
but adding that the feelings can be built by people because the environments of the party political committees in districts and province that go to a decision of removing him as the chairperson are doubted if they followed the constitution because they had influence.
"they did not respect the party constitution.
when a person is accused he is called to the party's ethical committees.
together with my accusations the procedures were not observed, they were decisions for people's interests, that is why they are associated with the oncoming party elections," he said.
as that continued, there had been some disagreements about the fate of the chairman who together with his party announcing revocation of his party sponsorship certificate which sponsored him to contest for chairmanship of the committee, according to the party, he is losing the qualities of being the chairman of the committee, he has emphasized he is still the chairman.
recently the secretary for campaigns for the CCM party in Mwanza province, Simon Mangelepa, told news reporters that the party has has stripped the leader of the chairmanship of the institution for the party's direction in the district and province asking him to resign voluntarily from the position so as to preserve the party's dignity.
when he was asked what the meaning of the party decision as the chairman he still claims to be the chairman of the party when the party announced to remove him from that position and if he does not see the silence of the party on the misconceptions degrades the party, chairman Mabina said that the party has fulfilled its responsibility other items should also start from there.
"as the party we have revoked the sponsorship that made him chairman and we have already given a statement to relevant parties including the assistant director for the institution.
it is upon those who are in the government now to take the necessary steps, the party is not involved with our sponsorship with him again, it is upon them there in the government," said Mabina and added that in a normal state if the party denies any leader sponsorship it goes upon the government and particularly the relevant minister to take action.
more reports explain that last week the chairman who was denied sponsorship by his party called for a finance committee meeting which was however postponed and held later under the vice-chairman, while other reports explaining that the deputy director of the department Pius Chembo prevented the first meeting.
when he was later asked about the meeting dispute and stopping the chairman, deputy director Chembo said: "I have not handled that issue.
I beg that you have some patience I am currently not in office I am on a trip in Arusha."
when talking on the issue, Polycarp said that he called for the first meeting and it was postponed because ordinary reasons just like other meetings are postponed and when the second meeting was called he was on a journey and therefore it force his vice to lead the meeting.
when asked for how long they will be at tag-of- war with his party, he explained that he cannot fight with his party except what is happening is a strategy for a few people's interest and not the party.
"I do not defy for my own benefit.
it is for the benefit of the party.
when I see that the interests of the party are in danger, I will resign immediately.
but as it is now this decision is made for the benefit of few, if it is wasteful, why don't they leave it for dollar instruments?
why is the Bahi member of parliament (Omar Badwel) is accused for bribery but is still a member of parliament, what is there that is special about the Misungwi chairmanship?
he cautioned his party to be keen with the decisions it makes since they might turn and bite the party in future especially in this multi-party political system.
"so now the punishment for squandering of five billion shillings is just being stripped of chairmanship and representation remains?
if Chadema comes here in 2015 and say your chairman squandered five billion and was stripped of chairmanship and representation remained, will the citizens understand the party?" questioned Polycarp and insisted that dollar instruments be left in place to work.
Magufuli saves four percentage of the budget
Julius Mathias, Mwananchi Magufuli Dar es Salaam.
within six months since coming to power, President John Magufuli has succeeded in saving four percent of his first budget in the actions he has taken in curbing expenditure and controlling corruption.
President Magufuli who was sworn in on November 5 last year, started by insisting on curbing government expenditure and increasing revenue collection from various sources something that he has achieved according to monthly reports by the Tanzanian Revenue Authority (TRA).
TRA announced that it had collected 1.4 trillion shillings in December last year, in January it collected 1.08 trillion shillings and 1.04 trillion shillings in February before collecting 1.316 trillion shillings in March. all those collections were beyond expectations.
despite the revenue collected by the procedures of that authority, President Magufuli has been able to save over 1.02 trillion shillings in the time he has been in power.
the government has proposed a 29.5 trillion shilling budget for the next financial year.
while reading the estimates and use of the revenue to the parliamentary committees, Doctor Philip Mpango the Minister for Finance and Planning said that four percentage of the budget, 17.7 trillion shillings would be for recurrent use and 11.8 trillion shillings for the purpose of development projects.
the amount saved by President Magufuli is about half of the income generated by sources that are not taxed and also more than twice the revenue that will be collected by all the councils in the country for that period.
it is a lot of money compared to those offered by the US Aid Agency (MCC) in the first phase to implement the distribution of electricity in the villages.
within the first 30 days, after making a surprise visit to the treasury and visiting the port several times he saved about 1 trillion shillings.
the more than 2,500 containers discovered to have been released without tax being paid for them and other charges gave the government 637.2 billion shillings.
those funds were the results of the mandatory payment and fines for the evaders.
in November last year when he opened parliament, the President refused to hold ceremonies organized by Members of Parliament and ordered the 225 million shillings to be relocated to areas where there was need.
that decision led to those funds buying 300 beds, 300 mattresses, 1,675 blankets and 30 wheelchairs that were handed over to the Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH).
at the meeting, the President told parliament that his measures of limiting travels abroad for public servants had saved 356.3 billion shillings which could build 400 kilometers of tarmacked road.
December 9, last year, Doctor Magufuli put off independence celebrations and directed that the 4 billion shillings allocated be used on the expansion of the road from Morocco to Mwenge, here in the city.
implementation of the directive is ongoing.
shortly after appointing ministers and their deputies, he canceled the orientation seminar for the leaders.
here he saved 2 billion shillings which were allocated to other alternative uses.
earlier in April, he scraped the Union Day celebrations and directed that the 2 billion shillings allocated for that be used for the expansion of the airport road to Mwanza.
in what appeared to be in support of the efforts at curbing expenditure, Parliament saved 6 billion shillings which it presented to the President in order to purchase desks for schools with the shortage within the country.

the responsibility of a parent as a child's first teacher
many studies on the learning environment have continued to emphasize that good education for the child begins at home.
the presence of a friendly learning environment at home gives a child an opportunity to grow in understanding and prepares the child well to learn before he starts school officially.
basically, a parent is the first teacher who can enable the child to learn well.
a child learns to walk, talk, eat, house chores and so forth to be of help to the parent.
if a parent will recognize their role as the child's teacher and execute it as required, the teacher's work at school is made easier.
let's look at four important areas that can help you as a parent, to execute your role as your child's teacher in that same home environment.
find learning materials for the child.
a child needs to be stimulated mentally, physically, emotionally and relationally from birth.
when the child is stimulated early, his understanding becomes ready to learn even before meeting his teacher in school.
to be stimulated appropriately, he needs important learning materials.
for example, you can ensure that the child gets colored pencils for drawing, papers and exercise books for writing, cartoons and various story books on CD-DVD, magazines and children's books, jumping ropes, bottle tops/materials for counting and other materials he can use to make his mind innovative.
many parents, especially from urban areas, use a lot of money to buy for their children already manufactured materials like "cars", "airplanes", "phones", "house hold items" and so forth.
even so, these materials have the danger of denying a child the chance of developing creativity and acquiring the knowledge of making things that go along with his needs.
bring him raw materials like boxes, a pair of scissors and gum that will help him to make the real things that he needs.
in doing this, a child develops the ability to think and realize what he thinks.
build for him the eagerness for self learning.
eagerness is the strength that pushes someone to be ready to put an effort in fulfilling the goals he set for himself.
parent, as the first teacher of the child, you have the responsibility of building for your child a big eagerness for wanting to learn.
for example, in order to develop his eagerness, you can build him psychologically to enable him to believe that he has the ability and he is able.
the belief that he is able is very important and it will be his pillar when he learns.
you can also give him examples of how education and knowledge are able to help someone solve problems they meet.
show him the opportunities ahead of him by relating them to his success in the classroom.
give him examples of famous scientists who discovered great things that changed people's lives.
narrate to him news of famous lawyers, civil rights activists, doctors who save people's lives, teachers, designers of famous buildings, road engineers, journalists and many other cadres.
these narrations build a major eagerness that increases the passion for education in a child.
at other times, narrations that begin with money against knowledge discourages children from putting efforts on education.
if you want your child to love education, show him how that education sometimes is more important than money.
follow up on his progress.
a child needs what he does to be recognized and make his parent happy.
when he knows that you're following up on his progress, he will put in an effort to work harder so that he can continue getting praise.
give him an opportunity to feel boastful by recognizing the effort he puts in learning.
do communications with his school teacher to know how he is doing.
when he discovers that you're following up on the goings on in his school, he will know you value him and he will be eager to do for you to know how able he is.
it's true sometimes you can meet news that you don't like if you don't go to school.
maybe his success level isn't the same as your expectations.
no reason to give up on him.
instead of deriding and showing him how he is "a couch", show the big faith you have in him.
confirm to him that you know how he can do much better.
furthermore, discover the special areas he showed his ability and if possible share with him in his other favorite activities.
when he sees you value the things he likes even if they aren't educational, he won't be ready to bring you down in things he knows you expect from him including education.
sometimes children fail to do well because we don't give them the help they need.
build a process of helping him academically.
sit with him in the evening, ask if he has been given what work to do at home.
give him help but don't cripple and make him dependent.
by doing that, you'll make him have a big passion for proving to you how able he is.
make him get used to following a daily time table.
many families don't have an environment that enables a child to learn in calmness.
an example is when adults who live with the child, use a lot of time watching television and listening to the radio in a way that prevents children from doing something different.
in other environments, children get lost in too much playing that isn't controlled in the neighborhood again without parental observation.
these things can't help a child learn.
ensure the environment at your home gives the child an opportunity of reading by himself without disturbance.
in the same way, help him to plan his affairs according to age.
a tradition of a timetable is built.
when he comes back from school, for example, he should know how long he will play, what time he will shower, what time he does household chores, take part in joint worship, being told bedtime stories and sleep.
alongside with a timetable that doesn't change now and again, make an effort of reducing some of his responsibilities that can be a hindrance to learning.
although sharing in menial work is very important to a child's development, put an effort in discovering what time these jobs could be a hindrance.
the foundation of a good education doesn't start in school and a child can't like school hastily without your effort parent.
if you fulfill your duty, you'll be surprised how he will learn easily.

an ardent fan of highlights surprises residents.
Ichaweri, Gatundu.
the area's rooster surprised customers in a bar when he quickly ran off with a highlights page that he removed from the copy of the Daily Nation belonging to a customer.
it is said that the guy is a fan of the highlights page but he didn't have money to buy his own copy of the paper.
on the day of incident, one secondary school teacher was relaxing at the bar reading the highlights column in the Daily Nation newspaper.
the teacher and his friends were discussing many exciting incidents that had been published in this newspaper, while taking alcoholic refreshments.
this rooster was attracted to the teacher's and the friends' discussion and borrowed the newspaper to read.
without hesitating the teacher handed Jombi the newspaper and the guy moved closer to the door where there was enough light.
suddenly, the guy pulled out the highlights page, folded it and put it in his pocket and returned the newspaper to the teacher.
after doing so, he went outside and took off like a horse at a competition.
efforts by the teacher and his friends who had come to drink together, to search for the rooster after realizing he had stolen the page were futile as he was never found again.
it was not revealed immediately how things went when the rooster and the newspaper owner met later on.

Wariona names Mwalimu Nyerere's betrayers
former Constitution Review Commission chairman Judge Joseph Warioba has said politicians who blame him for betraying the Father of the Nation Mwalimu Julius Nyerere about the union are the betrayers since they inserted into the constitution things that contradict the agreements of the union.
Judge Warioba has said that the betrayal includes the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar removing the Union Parliament's authority in making the law, recognizing Zanzibar as an independent country and adding things about the Union without following the constitution.
he has given that statement following a streak of slander and insults that have been thrown his way by some of the representatives of the Special Parliament for the Constitution from CCM and some of the government leaders after the Commission he led suggested a three government system.
speaking two nights ago on a 45 minute program that is broadcast by the ITV Channel, Judge Warioba said the leaders from both sides of government who are blaming him are the ones that disrupted the Union.
"Mwalimu left Parliament with full authority, he left one country, he left 11 items of the Union now there are 22, luckily president Jakaya Kikwete explained in parliament that how those items were increased," he said and added:
"in determining the increase in the items of the Union is how it was reducing the authority of Zanzibar, 11 items that were left by Mwalimu were inserted constitutionally but these additional ones were inserted unofficially."
Judge Warioba said that during his lifetime, Mwalimu Nyerere respected and protected that constitution, the ones who broke it are the betrayers.
"now between myself and them, who is Mwalimu's betrayer, had he (Mwalimu) been here, who would have appeared as the betrayer of the Union Government?
it is they who have disrupted. what Mwalimu left is different with what is seen now," said Judge Warioba.
about parliament
Judge Warioba said many development plans made in the Union Parliament are executed on the mainland only.
"not only that, that parliament only discusses issues concerning the mainland and does not include the Zanzibar side.
Zanzibar on its side also just discusses its own affairs and decides on its own but the name of that parliament is Union," said Judge Warioba.
from this environment, Judge Warioba said Zanzibar decided to remove that parliament's authority in the making of the laws through the Zanzibar House of Representatives.
the constitution of the United Republic says that laws that are made inside that parliament are used on both sides of the Union, but Zanzibar changed that through their constitution and said that all laws made in that parliament must also pass through the House of Representatives," and added: "they (Zanzibar) did not stop there, they made a constitutional review in 2010 that dismantled the constitution recognizing Zanzibar as an independent country, removed the Union's president's authority to establish districts and provinces in Zanzibar contrary to the Union's constitution, and for that reason Zanzibar broke down the powers of the Union parliament."
moreover, he said that the action seemed to practically break down the Union after removing the president's powers and recognize two full presidents in two different countries.
"normally, a country has one commander in chief who receives the 21 gun salute, the Union Army salutes two presidents, something that is impossible," he said.
Tanzanian's complaints
Judge Warioba said Tanzania mainland on its side determined the Tanganyikan's complaints to include missing several opportunities in Zanzibar.
"people from the mainland on their part say that Zanzibar takes part in the Union parliament, inspects mainland projects and questions them but they do not have the power to take get involved those things on the Zanzibar side," he said.
he added: "even worse, they say that Zanzibaris can own land and get citizenship in the mainland but those rights cannot be found by a Tanganyikan, the only way we saw it's good Zanzibar too should bring its issues inside the union but it was impossible".
the issue of statistics
Judge Warioba wanted parliamentarians to not be bothered with statistics and instead to answer questions that arise from the partners in the Union.
"statistics are not a problem. we have not done a new thing but it was only just as a repeat of the Nyalali Commission. those who question those statistics, did they not see a fault in the opinion statistics of the 20 percent in Judge Nyalali?
he said that his Commission went round the whole country accompanied by clerks who recorded on tape, video and writing for the purpose of keeping archives in the Commissions website.
meet with Prezzo's circus to the beauties!
Jackson Ngechu Makini 'CMB Prezzo' was born on Wednesday January 09, the year 1980.
he's a Kenyan legendary rapper who was one of the stars who represented their countries in the Big Brother Africa 'StarGame', 2012 competition.
if you didn't know, the guy was born in Nairobi 33 years ago, he lived a neighborhood life in the Eastleigh area and he'll be one of the best musicians who'll give an exciting entertainment at the 2013 Hope Festival, which will close the Dar es Salaam neighborhood and its outskirts at the National Stadium on July 7 this year.
Prezzo is a big musician, who started to 'hustle' in music for many years, he became famous in the first years of 21st century.
together with facing many obstacles, the star came to shine after his songs were accepted by thousands of his fans who were listening, requesting them in various radio stations and televisions while attending his open concerts and clubs.
his first album is Naleta Action which he released in 2004 with popular songs like Naleta Action, Let's Get Down, Mahangaiko, Leo ni Leo, Mimi na Wewe, Mafans among other hit songs.
in that album, the guy featured his mother who sang several lines in one of his songs.
the album sold several copies and made Prezzo believe that he had accepted East Africa as a result of his type of emotional songs.
Prezzo is known because of his expensive life style that he loves for example wearing expensive chains, clothes, vehicles among other expensive things.
later adult person Prezzo was included in the song 'Tazama Mbele' of his once lover of that period which was produced by Ennovator of Samawati productions while the video was managed by Tedd Josiah.
that song performed well by being position one for eight weeks in various East African radio and television stations.
in 2006, Prezzo released a new Prezzo single in which his video was managed by Ted Josiah of Blu Zebra.
the video was good but it was criticized with allegations that it was produced at a very costly fee of 500,000 Kenya shillings.
there was no video which had spent that amount of money during that period.
there passed a little silence, as he continued to hit all shows inside and outside of East Africa, Nigeria, and Europe.
he later continued with the pattern of releasing one song after another like Liqher, My City My town, Unataka Nini, 4sho 4shizzy in which he featured Ulopa, Nipe Nikupe featuring AY and Celebration of life which he recently released featuring Chess.
Big Brother Africa 'StarGame' 2012 Prezzo joined the competition of BBA 'StarGame' 2012 after seeing that it was something that would give him many challenges in life.
apart from desiring money, he wanted to be seen in big television stations in Africa for 24 hours and seven days for he is someone who likes to be seen that he is 'attention'.
he says, he loves watching television and movies like Scarface and the people he aspires to be like in that industry are Al Pacino and Mos Def of the river.
he eats everything apart from a stool.
the book he loves is 48 Laws of Power.
he wants to become like Obama who loves Kenya is Nairobi it does matter whether is North or South as long as home is home.
he wishes to be like President Barack Obama of America because he believes in himself and he can do what was impossible to become possible because of influence he has.
the love life in romantic matters CMB Prezzo has become a topic of discussion during his celebrity period and many other things have been said.
Prezzo and Sheila, if we leave his early days as a baby of babies, Prezzo turned to be a topic of discussion after he emerged with a beautiful lady from Kenya, Sheila Mwanyigha 'Nikki'.
it is true that the two have been together for long while going 'out' and in various activities using a convoy of expensive vehicles such as Limousine like president.
there was a time it was explained that he was the first musician to use a helicopter in East Africa while some said the helicopter was his mother's.
in addition to being with Nikki for a long time, suddenly there was silence while allegations emerged that he married secretly.
however, when he was announced that he is going to BBA, news emerged that he has another wife by the name Huddah Monroe 'The Lady Boss' who represented Kenya in BBA this year before she was removed in the first week while Prezzo and Goldie were at construction in BBA, Prezzo was alleged to have a love affair with a participant from Nigeria, musician Goldie who was unconscious few days after the completion of the competition while there was a news that the two are planning to have a 'big' wedding.
Prezzo, Diva and The Boss Lady, a few days after Goldie had died, Prezzo partied in Bongo because he is a friend to the likes of Ambwene Yessayah 'AY' and then there emerged claims that, he fell in love with Loveness Malinzi 'Diva' of Clouds FM.
there ware a lot of stories, Diva got kicked from news agencies in East Africa and other places.
while that was going on, recently there emerged another drama.
this time The Lady Boss came out alleging that Diva had snatched her love hence proving that in addition to old age, Prezzo was favorited by ladies!
Mandela's ANC and Nyerere's CCM
December 21, 2013
Nelson Mandela's party of African national Congress (ANC) and Mwalimu Julius Nyerere's Revolution party (CCM) are very similar parties.
one is that, at one time those parties were led by people with reputable characters to a point of those parties being attributed to the leaders.
these are leaders who are praised and taken to heaven by some of their fans and followers in and out of their countries.
there are some who say that the two, meaning Mandela in ANC and Nyerere in CCM are saints.
even though Mandela used to decline often that he is not a saint, in Tanzania there are efforts being made that wants the Catholic church in Vatican to officially announce Mwalimu Nyerere as a saint.
another thing that makes those parties look alike is how they can manage their countries, although their management nowadays is not as firm as it used to be initially when they reigned in the leadership of their governments in countries with democratic constitutions.
I believe that because they have that kind of constitution, there countries that drag themselves and not perish.
together with having that constitution, those countries also have powerful communal and steady basic citizen rights, they have opposition parties that are firm, vigilant media.
South Africa on its side has more than that.
it has powerful trade unions, free and stable legal system together with big and powerful corporations and businesses.
with no doubt, there are differences between the parties.
one is that the parties originated for the purpose of fighting different enemies who had different systems of ruling them, though all of them were humiliating Africans.
and more so, they spearheaded their independence struggles under different environments.
another difference is that contrary to CCM, the party of ANC is a party which is like an umbrella, below it are other powerful parties to support it.
among them is South African Communist Party (SACP) and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu).
some of the ministers of the government lead by ANC are leaders or main members of those parties.
and even Mandela himself aside from being the ANC leader, he was also a secret member and a representative of the executive committee of the Communist Party.
the party of CCM and its government, on their side do not have such like structure.
and they never had a structure like that since their origin from where it came.
when we talk about CCM during those days we especially talk about TANU.
and the biggest difference is that despite the party of ANC has really passed CCM by age- ANC was born on January 8, 1912 and is the oldest party in the African continent- moreover, it does not have a great experience in driving the government as CCM.
both parties have succeeded in their great objective of bringing independence from white colonialism in Tanganyika or discriminating leadership of Boers in South Africa.
above those great achievements together with other developments in general, the parties have failed to get majority of the citizens of their countries out of poverty.
in South Africa the situation is worse.
discriminatory leadership and racism was stopped in that country after the first democratic elections in the year 1994.
that, without a doubt, was a great achievement, but it did not get millions of black Africans in that country out of poverty.
indeed, their situation became increasingly worse following emergence of economic discrimination.
this discrimination was not racism because a group of African capitalists came up, among them being the top ranked leaders of ANC, Cosatu and the Communist party.
these ones used their positions in their parties or in the government to enrich themselves.
let me just mention one example of Missus Joyce Moloi-Moropa who is an ANC member of parliament and the treasurer for the Communist Party.
this honorable communist woman is the Director of Masincazelane Investments Company that was formed by the Communist Party.
as if that's not enough, she has 19 percent shares in private university Letsatsi solutions and is the director in a brick making company called Zebediela bricks.
Missus Moloi-Moropani is only one of the main leaders of ANC who engage themselves with large businesses.
rumor has it that Zebediela Bricks company alone every year earns a profit of millions of American dollars.

Kombani: action to be taken against drunk servants.
by Pendo Mtibuche, Dodoma. the minister for state, office of the president, public service management Missus Celina Kombani, has directed the head of ministries of governance and service in the local governments to take actions against servants who are excessive consumers of alcohol, rude, lazy, corrupt, degenerates, troublesome, bribe takers and those who misuse their power.
Missus Kombani gave that directive in Dodoma yesterday while opening the annual meeting for head of governance and service ministries of the local governments.
she said that currently there is a lot of law, principles, procedures and guideline violation in public service such as excessive alcohol consumption and abuse of citizens who are taxpayers.
she added that those acts are part of things that happen in local governments and many others which are done to citizens when they go to seek service but the heads of ministries are blind to these without taking any action.
"in some of our hospitals, patients receive indecent statements especially pregnant women who go to seek delivery services, response to several letters delay but you are still blind to, I now want you to start taking action," she said.
she said that public service in those positions is faced with the challenge of the relevant officials (the heads of governance and service departments), not abiding by the law, principles and directions when dealing with governance and service issues.
she added that, right now some of those officials don't follow the public service law number 8 of the year 2002 together with the principles of public service of the year 2003 when dealing with discipline.
as a result of that state, most of the servants who have been suspended from work have been winning cases in court therefore the government running at a lose by paying fines and disturbances.
"violation of procedures in handling disciplinary matters has been causing the government to use a lot of time in handling cases and to continue paying salaries the servants who have been dismissed and getting them back to work after they win their cases," she said.
talking about the challenge of insufficient professionals in different fields, Missus Kombani said many servants are deployed in town regions therefore affecting service provision in the villages.
due to that situation, he directed the officers to ensure that all authorities that have have many servants in towns take them to the villages so as to create proper equality.
on his part, assistant secretary in the office of the president, public service management Mister Hab Mkwizu said that the evaluations done by their office show that human resource in local governments is still a problem.
"many administrative and service issues are still dealt with without regard to legal, principles and existing guidelines and thus resulting to various issues on the servants, losing their allowances and increase of complaints.
the chief chemist to investigate those with two organs.
written by Angela Semaya, Dodoma.
published: 15th September 2016
orders of laboratory for senior chief of government, it will have power and authority of investigating people with two private parts and to differentiate which is stronger than the other.
the 2016 Laboratory Authority of the Chief Government Chemist bill, that was passed the other night at ten o'clock in parliament gives the chief chemist the authority to investigate and identity a person's sex and solving controversies in the person who will have been born with two sexes.
"honorable members of parliament I see many of you think the chief chemist's work is to investigate genes to identify the legitimacy of the parent and the child, because I see many members of parliament are supporting that, but gene technology also concerns the identification of gender, people you find women or men who are born with male and female sexual organs, therefore we look at which gene is dominant," said the Minister for Health, Social Development, Gender, Elders and Children, Ummy Mwalimu.
Ummy was responding to the contributions of parliamentarians who contributed during discussion of the Chief Chemist Laboratory's Billing Authority in 2016 before the passing of the bill the previous night, the ones who wanted the laboratory's authority to educate citizens about its activities.
he said because of that law, now the chief chemist through his laboratory he is able to say how female or male are the ones with strengthen, but there is also a question of ensuring of recognition of a human being especially when disaster occurs in addition to when people travel in groups.
he agreed with the parliamentarians that there is a need to educate the citizens about the work of the laboratory of the chief chemist, where many of them think, does the work is to identify the genetic relationship of a parent and child, but now they should understand even those who were born with two genders can be able to solve that problem by showing clearly the dominant gene or the stronger gene, if it's male or female.
he said the laboratory of the chief chemist of the government has been there from 1890 and it has been a government tool for investigation of biochemistry in laboratory in different products and in addition that it has been investigation food chemistry, drugs and cosmetics especially when there is a controversy or involvement of questions on criminal cases.
while explaining more, he said on the side of the food and drug authority (TFDA) they are working on quality regulatory of food, drugs and cosmetics and the laboratory works on investigative chemistry.
the chief chemistry laboratory work is to do chemistry research, genetic, criminal and scientific sciences.
this organ doesn't measure control, instead, it conducts investigations for national interest or controversial issues and competitiveness," said the minister.
giving the example of the maize, he said there was a problem of the blight poison, therefore the chief chemist is doing a laboratory examination and says, they have found that the maize has poison or not, or a trader may bring the baby's milk to TFDA and it get's trouble, the chief chemist will do a laboratory examination and say if there is poison or there are chemicals that are not safe for human use.
after the laboratory examination, whoever has the mandate of saying that this maize should not be sold or these milk should not be sold is TFDA and not the laboratory of the chief chemist.
"just as a trader can bring a product, TFDA has doubts about it, in that, this owner of the product can appeal to the chief chemist so that his product can be tested to prove to the TFDA that his product is safe," he said.
Minister Ummy was responding to the concerns of the members of parliament, who were afraid that the chief chemist's laboratory would interfere with institutions such as the TFDA and the Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS).
he also spoke of giving the final authority to the laboratory, saying that in all nations of the world with those laboratories, the government should have a final spokesperson for investigations on laboratory issues, genetics, criminology and criminal cases, but also does not refute the law or other investigation laboratories initiated in accordance with various laws.
in terms of allocating enough budget, Ummy said the government had received opinions of the members of parliament and having passed the bill, the laboratory has been granted a status of authority and has now been awarded a status and so its role must be good for running laboratory operations but also employing 400 staff as present 192 are not enough.
Minister Ummy said they have received the advice of the parliamentary standing committee to investigate the use of shisha and added that already the government chemist did an investigation and identified that shisha users mix it with bhang, heroine and that's why the government has prohibited its use.
however, he said that it will be more responsible to investigate so as to identify which level of additives are found in shisha and why the government should continue to ban the use of shisha in the country.

those who were taken to custody by district commissioner have been released and paid the charges.
written by our author, Sengerema.
published 15 October 2016
three servants who were taken into custody by the district Kamishna of Sengerema, Mwanza, Emmanule Kipole including Acting Director of the district committee, Oscar Kapinga have been released from custody and acted upon the order given to them by the district commissioner.
acting director together with acting district treasurer, Paul Sweya and accountant Hassan Moshi were taken into custody by the orders of the district commissioner last Wednesday after going against an order requiring them to pay Sengerema sanitation workers who had proceeded up to that committee's office.
the day before yesterday at 10 o'clock in the morning, those public servants were released from police custody of Sengerema district to go pay the sanitation workers a sum of 29,000 shillings per person even though that money didn't satisfy the thirst of those cleaners.
the execution of payment for those individuals was done at 4pm, shortly after the servants were released.
the CCM has lost an opportunity to clean itself up, now they will face repercussions!
November 15, 2012
Revolutionary Party (CCM) only had one opportunity to redeem itself and demonstrate that it deserves to be looked at and accepted again by Tanzanians.
this position came through the VIII general meeting that was culminated in Dodoma.
this Meeting, as I showed in last week's article, is the highest organ in the CCM.
it is a more superior organ even to the constitution of CCM.
it is this meeting that plans for all national leaders of the party and it's the meeting that dictates the direction of CCM's politics.
in the past - before most repatriated parties were introduced - the CCM's General Meeting was the determinant of the direction our nation would take for the next five years.
unfortunately, the CCM has not only lost its direction but also seems to have lost its history.
this meeting was meant for restoration.
CCM's general meeting was meant to be for restoring and pulling weeds out within CCM.
leaders who were not ousted at the lower levels due to various reasons - especially after failing to have policies to unmask - they were supposed to be forcefully exposed in the CCM's general meeting.
CCM has really condoned corruption to the extend that even the righteous appear to be in a pool of mud.
and a topic can easily arise through the CCM's failure to clean itself up, it has confirmed that no one is clean.
this meeting was initially meant for reinvention because of one main reason - the CCM has been corrupted, they have soiled each other as a result of its leadership, the nation has also been soiled.
from after the 2005 election but largely after the Richmond's 2006-2008 scandal the conflicts that emerged inside CCM confirms that they cannot resonate at all.
it is that lack of understanding that has been a problem in CCM and in the nation.
Kikwete has demonstrated weakness.
one of the thing that has emerged at the meeting and for a fact from that NEC's meeting at Butiana that Chairman Jakaya Kikwete has failed to demonstrate the steadfastness of providing proper leadership to his party.
since that sitting at Butiama until the most recent one in Dodoma, President Kikwete has been someone who gives orders that he has been repeating like a stuck recorder.
there is nothing new that they said at Kizota that they have never said before about his party.
he has already talked about the issue of dissolving groups, on the issue of those who failed in the elections should not bring problems, he already spoke about it and for sure, even the issue of threats including murder among CCM members are not new (he already mentioned before that CCM members have reached a point that they fear welcoming each other for a glass of water for fear of being poisoned).
his recent speech was a repetition of the same song that is not danceable.
he was not any brilliant more than to continue talking in general about the same things to the same people.
we remember when he changed the cabinet ministers last time, he promised that those who caused the ministers' downfall would also be removed. today we are heading towards the end of the year and individuals continue to hang on and maintain power.
Chairman Kikwete is not feared.
he cannot talk about cleanliness while his own daughter is suspected of various activities that do not reflect his cleanliness.
Chairman Kikwete is getting more problems because he has not come out as a person who can stand for and make things happen.
he has led rebels into his party, in the CCM's meetings, he keeps on complaining, blaming and leaving individuals on the sideline to continue disagreeing about their belief in democracy, not knowing that by doing that he has weakened CCM more than ever before.
it has gotten to the point where the union of our nation is in jeopardy because of his party and his fellow party members.
when it gets to a point the wife of the founder of the union says she doesn't see the benefits of the union, then we are in trouble!
CCM's failures Chadema's joy
personally, I believe that because CCM managed to get to this meeting and they have failed to redeem themselves and also failed to demonstrated that they are truly united (as the topic of the meeting indicated) it is clear that heading to 2015, CCM has confirmed disgruntled groups that we will be seeing.
these groups will continue to trouble us not only because of Kikwete but because of other CCM leaders who have failed to get an opportunity redeem themselves and they have weakened the party further.

the best farming for rice irrigation.
proper preparation of the land is a fundamental fact in improving rice irrigation farming.
if the land is not prepared well, it causes the good recommended methods to not show results at the expected levels especially in the level of production.
fundamentally land preparation is supposed to take place correctly and timely in the expected procedure.
the following are the seven important fundamental steps in rice farming:
1. cleaning the land.
clean the land early before the season starts.
collect and destroy stumps and all other garbage.
remnants of crops can be used in making nutrient manure.
if necessary, use fire very carefully because fire can destroy the environment, kill friendly insects, destroy soil and burn compost.
2. farming
cultivation helps to reduce weeds, allows good air and water circulation, makes it easy for the roots to penetrate and mixes crop residues in the ground.
when cultivating, anticipation is needed to prevent damage to the equilibrium of the land.
the depth of cultivation is 10 and 15 centimeters.
in order to make cultivation work easy and fast, it's good to use easy tools/machines like motorized and animal-drawn tractors.
3. to renovate/construct corded edges.
after digging, ensure that corded edges have been renovated to be able to conserve water well.
if it's new land, corded edges construction should be done by following the given expertise.
a firm edge is important to control the water well in the field.
4. disturbing
put water in the field about 3 to 5 centimeter above the ground level to complete good distortion.
the hoe is used but to make work easy and fast it's good to use motorised or animal-drawn tractors.
when using animal-drawn or motorised tractors, don't put water in the field more than a day before.
the well shaped field enables the roots of seedling to penetrate into the soil well.
5. balancing the field.
after disturbing its necessary that the field has been activated good.
the farm which is rectify, allows good penetration of water.
during rectification, the water source has to be 3-5 centimeter over the same ground level to make the work easy. this work uses a wood rake to pull out the residue from the upper parts going through lower parts.
6. the causes and effects for misleading of water irrigation.
to get enough water, it's necessary to ensure that lack of irrigation water is reduced to a large extent and farmers irrigate at the required level without exceeding the level.
sources of improper water irrigation in schemes, for example, includes: water that runs out from the main pipes, in the middle and those small ones for distributing water in the fields
water that is lost in the fields during irrigation.
the loss of water in the drainage, in the center and those for distributing water is caused by the type of soil that made the drainage edges, the dirt and poor construction of drainage.
in a number of schemes the lack of water in the drainage is caused by leaking in the embankment of the drainage and soaking underneath was a major impact to the availability of water in the lands that are far from the edges.
equally another effect was a lot of water going to areas it wasn't needed and causing water to be still for a long time.
therefore farmers are advised to reduce this water shortage in the drainage through construction and cementing.
the water shortage in farms during irrigation is caused by leakage in the embankment that surrounds the corded edges, leaking underneath and exceeding the amount of irrigation that is needed.
this is mostly caused by poor construction of the corded edges.
the construction of the corded edges and the stabilization of the corded edges has helped in reducing water shortage to a large extent and eventually increasing production and farmers' income.

Hilal Hemed Hilal: the fastest Tanzanian swimmer
November 07, 2013
when I was filling the incoming visitor's book in IST Masaki national school, my mind was on the guy who holds a record of swimming the fastest in this country.
he is called Hilal Hemed Hilal and his record is 24 seconds swimming across a 50 meters pool.
last week he broke the record by bringing Tanzania 15 medals when he participated in a clubs tournament in Kenya that was held in the city of Mombasa.
the competition involved all swimming clubs in Kenya.
there were 30 Tanzanians from different clubs and formed a team they called Tanzania swimming squad.
from the 15 medals he swept, 5 are gold, seven are silver and three are bronze.
as if that is not enough, he held the second position on the men's side the first position going to Torg Pragassa from Kenya.
"I started swimming when I was very young, at the time swimming was compulsory in the nursery school I went to.
later when I started form one at Aga Khan the year 2009 is when I realized I am talented in swimming.
"teacher Amina Mfaume, is the one who discovered my talent and advised me to join Taliss (Tanzania Life Swimming Society) swimming club.
it was early 2010, when I participated in the first competition in Nairobi for third and fourth zone but I did not get any medal because I only went to gain experience.
"I later went to India in the Commonwealth competition, I swam 100 and 50 meters.
similarly I did not get anything. in the same year, 2010 I went to Dubai for the world competition, but I also did not get anything."
therefore, Hilal did not get anything in all the competitions he participated in in 2010.
however, they helped him add his skills and be more confident.
sometimes competing does not only mean winning.
"when I started swimming I was using 29 seconds to complete 50 meters in all styles.
but every time I got into a new competition I added my ability, when I participated in the Indian competition I was using 27 seconds and when I went to Dubai I was using 26 seconds.
"remember in swimming 50 meters in 26 seconds, very few people can get to this level.
but I saw it was not enough, I kept training and until now I complete 50 meters in 24 seconds which in Tanzania and some African countries no one reaches this level," explains Hilal confidently.
in the year 2011 he participated in regional competitions in Uganda and Zambia, at different periods.
in that year is when he started to show his fierceness of collecting medals where he won himself 20 medals the whole year.
six gold, 10 silver and seven bronze.
however, in the year 2012 Hilal was required to participate in Olympics games that were held in London but his name was struck the last minutes.
Raia Mwema talked to the national swimming team coach who is also Hilal's coach, Alex Mwaipasi and he said that he too does not know why his boy's name was struck.
for now it is not only Tanzania but East Africa, when you mention a clever and fast swimmer then it's Hilal Hilal's name that comes to mind, but we are surprised the national swimming association removed his name at the last minute from the list of people who were supposed to represent the country in the Olympics.
up to now that issue affects my boy psychologically, Tanzania has opportunists in this swimming associations," said Alex appearing so touched by the act.
moreover, currently Hilal holds the record for all styles in swimming in the country, (freestyle, butterfly and Backstroke) in a 50 meters distance.
"every year Tanzania has club swimming competitions, we call Tanzania open championships since 2012 up to this year, I have been the first in all styles, therefore no one has broken my record till now," he said.
in the past two years, the youth has participated in Istanbul competitions in Turkey but he did not get anything, he also went to Barcelona in Spain and he also did not get anything.
when he explained the reason for Tanzanian swimmers performing poorly in international competitions, Hilal said it is poor preparations and the government not cooperating with simmers.
the youth who was born in July 1994 has completed his fourth form last year at Aga Khan and he has dreams of joining any University in the world to study Bachelor of Arts in Sports Management.

'federation cup is confusing'
Matereka Jalilu, Mwananchi oalbert@mwananchi.co.tz
Dodoma.
misunderstandings about the federation cup match that is organized by the Tanzanian football federation (TFF) came out in the middle of this week from some teams failing to arrive in the field for different reasons.
in Dodoma town, CDA was to play against Milambo of Tabora.
information of that match have been released at the time when leaders of that team were asking themselves without answers the exact day of that game because of unavailability of official information that showed the date together with the field that will be used for that match.
secretary general of CDA 'home children', Ringo Mussiba said they did have that match information until the other day Wednesday when was told by TFF that CDA will host Milambo and the game will be played in Jamhuri grounds Dodoma.
"the problem of this federation cup even last season has more challenges, information is not released as it should be like other leagues but also the organization of the match itself, clubs are suffering even the available share we are not given all."
Mussiba said that Milambo will be forced to pitch more than 10 camps in Dodoma town because apart from that match it will wait January first to play second division league games, his the second round game after the previous match in Tabora town after it ended in a tie of 1-1 at Ali Hassan Mwiny grounds.
at the same time CDA and Polisi Dodoma have been given eight balls by Dodoma province football association (Dorefa) in order to improve their preparations for the game particularly after those two teams did well away last week.
billions lost in kind in NBC Jul 25, 2012
the situation is not stable at the National Bank of Commerce (NBC) after the bank's general director, Lawrence Mafuru, was suspended, good citizen has identified.
the bank's internal information, which the Government of Tanzania owns about 30 percent of the stock, explains that there is pressure on the government, through the Bank of Tanzania and the treasury, to take immediate measures to protect Tanzania's interest in the bank.
but while putting pressure on an urgent action, an investigation by Good Citizen revealed that already dollar instruments, in partnership with BoT, has begun to keep an eye on NBC.
however, the study is being conducted in the country's largest banking network in allegedly a state of emergency, there are controversial efforts that involve dirty techniques to ultimately hide the facts for the purposes of protecting chief criminals against law enforcement.
according to a study of this newspaper involving various NBC officials, at the moment foreign investors in the bank have been doing all sorts of sabotage for a long time and on the other hand endeavoring to silence the patriarchs who seem to be their obstacles in achieving their dirty approach.
statements that this newspaper has suggested that one of the issues being monitored by dollar instruments is currently the purchase of a banking network that specializes in keeping customer records.
professionally the network is known as Flexcube Database.
the network purchased by NBC officials who are foreign nationals working in the joint venture bank between Tanzania and South Africa, has been estimated to cost 30 million US dollars.
but the issue of controversy leading to need for further investigation is another statement that the same network has been purchased by the NMB bank at a cost of six million US dollars.
apart from the investigation that is concerned with the price being high in the purchase of that industrial plant, the investigation also aims at looking at the quality of that industrial plant which has been costing the NBC a lot of money due to bringing experts outside the country to do repairs at a high cost.
"when a slight change is made to Flexcube it costs 60,000 US dollars per change (100 million shillings) off the cost of keeping the professionals in the country in housing and other costs," explains one banking expert who is currently engaging in professional consultancy activities.
Good Citizen contacted the Head of Marketing NBC, Mwinda Mfugale about the suspicions directed to the bank.
however, Mwinda did not have any answers to every question as stated in this article and instead replied to our author saying, "the suspicions mentioned are general, they have not been directed to anyone and I do not have information on the analysis of such suspicions, so I cannot talk about those issues beyond the information we provided to the media about the suspension of the director for investigation."
but with these answers from Mwinda, more information from NBC explains that the bank has been deliberately targeted by some foreigners in the banking system to the extent of expelling them and its senior customers, including one of the largest industrial producer in the country.
they deliberately killing (NBC), expelling big customers.
they are involved in bad loans, which are causing a major shake to threaten even BoT," explains one officer in one of the bank's branches in the center of Dar es Salaam.
due to the shake, BoT has begun to closely monitor movements of the major bank in the country, Good Citizen has said that the bank's shareholders may have to raise more capital, which could raise questions about why banks do not increase their profits different from situation is in many other banks in the country.
"Tanzanians we have been like a farmer's field, a fair Tanzanian citizen as a fraudulent persecutor who punishes others for doing wrong.
they have now reached a point of wanting to devour her even in her community," says one senior officer from the Ministry of Finance.
in addition to the shopping area, NBC has also been losing billions of money in debt collection.
in the debt collection area, billions are lost using a method of cancellation of some debts in a complex environment.
by eliminating theft of billions in the debt collection process and shopping area, another type of robbery takes place in the submission of mortgage auction funds.
the investigation should not end on flex purchases only, it should go far beyond other devices such as doors, cameras and other devices that are really a bit of controversy as well as transportation of money and security issues, says one officer in the NBC, in Dar es Salaam city.
the worst fears have now spread into the NBC because some workers begin to feel the presence of a plot to demand all the bank's shares taken by foreigners.
the trap that causes that fear to patriotic workers is mentioned is to build arguments for forcing the Government of Tanzania to put a capital increment in that bank and, if it fails, then the stocks of the government be sold and in selling the buyers will have been preplanned and finally the bank being owned 100 percent by foreigners.
in the current NBC, ABSA from South Africa owns 55 percent of the shares and the Tanzanian Government with 30 percent, and 15 percent of the shares are owned by the International Finance Corporation (IFC-International Monetary Fund).
however, ABSA has already been negotiated and purchased by the Barclays International Bank and other new reports indicating that one of the three NBC owners, IFC, is ready to sell its shares.
due to IFC's willingness to sell its shares, some NBC staff advise it that it would be well for the Government of Tanzania to take the shares instead of selling them.
but while all of this continued on the NBC, reports arriving at our newspaper Good Citizen, said that the Bank's Board of Directors is expected to meet today Wednesday to discuss their banking situation, including the fate of Mafuru and other employees.
Mafuru was suspended by the NBC board on charges of letting an independent investigation, a step which he said he is self-confident, clean and expects to continue his work after the investigation.
until December 2010, NBC had assets worth 1.47 trillion shillings in shareholders' deposits amounting to 153.1 billion shillings, that is according to the bank's website.
NBC was established in the country in 1967 when the Government of Tanzania, under Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, when conducting the financing of financial institutions, including banks.
in 1997, NBC was divided into three different institutions.
the first institution was called NBC Holding Corporation (NBC-Agency Corporation responsible for managing NBC's mother property), the second institution called the National Microfinance Bank (NMB) and the third institution called NBC (1997) Limited.
after the division, in 2000, the South African Banking Corporation (ABSA Group Limited) purchased a lot of NBC (1997) Limited stocks which were being sold, a purchase that contributed to severe opposition in the country being described as a sale at cast prices.
the sale was severely opposed by Mwalimu Julius Nyerere who, in general, was not pleased with the privatization process and especially for public-owned companies which were running through profit.
in the ABSA Group's acquisition of 55 percent, the Tanzanian government 'allocated itself' 30 percent of IFC shares, a subsidiary of the World Bank, bought 15 percent of the stock.
in this 'sale', the NBC was called National Bank of Commerce (Tanzania) Limited.

the red Simba have said they will keep on with their program of having annual general meeting on 11 December this year as they announced targeting to make corrections on the constitution.
Simba's spokesman, Haji Manara said yesterday that the meeting follows the procedures of the club's constitution and that it does not concern any leader of the national sports debate (BMT) but members and their club.
he said the government through the ministry of communication, culture, art and sports, Nape Nnauye said they don't have any problem on the change of the club formation insisting that the procedure be followed and the club constitution be adhered to.
"if it is following the procedure we have done so, but we are disappointed by the secretary general (BMT) Mohamed Kiganja's opinion of showing dissatisfaction with the ongoing process of bringing change in the operation of our club," he said.
he said that the Simba leaders are ready to follow the law and legal procedures required by the government in order to attain their objective of bringing change that is needed right now in their club.
also, he said in any meeting not everyone will agree with what is expected to be done, but it is important to check what is accepted by the majority than the minority objecting.
he said that what is accepted by the majority is what is right therefore it is not important to predict that there are those who will refuse because it is normal in any development.
however, Kiganga said recently, "we cannot stop Simba from meeting if they have decided to meet for their peace to discuss and they will bring us whatever they will discuss.
he added that, "we as the government we keep saying that meetings are not problems to us, but the problem is the decisions that may divide their club or to divide the citizens, that is where we don't want."
the process of Simba and Yanga going to changes started two months ago where later on the government through BMT announced to stop and make changes on their club constitutions before doing any other step.

the national election of ODM stirred up in Kasarani.
and Charles Wasonga.
a black cloud for politics covered the ODM party early this year, when its national election results in chaos which happened in the sports ground of Kasarani, Nairobi.
chaos started shortly after casting votes started, where a special member of parliament Isaac Mwaura when he climbs on top of a table to complain that his name does appear on ballot papers.
that member of parliament said that his name was suppose to be number six on that ballot paper but it was removed and his space was taken by Peter Ole Musei without special reason to be given either him to be consolidate.
he was vying for a special post for deputy secretary general in the camp of Budalangi member of parliament Ababu Namwamba (now the prime minister) who vying chair of secretary general in the Nation.
he claimed that there was a conspiracy to throw him out of the contest while saying the electoral board, the ODM party leader refused to hear his complaint.
and suddenly violence broke out when people dressed in black suits (who later were named "Men in Black") began kicking and breaking ballot boxes while turning down the tables and destroying other voting materials.
running off, the delegates who were in a line waiting for their turn to vote were forced to run while others sought refuge to prevent themselves from being harmed by chairs that were thrown in the air with those huge men.
the free movie took place before Mister Odinga and other invited guests including his fellow party leader of Cord Mister Kalonzo Musyoka.
several minutes before Mwaura submitted his complaints, the member of parliament for Dagoretti North Simba Arati was harshly criticized when he was given a chance to speak.
Mister Arati, a close associate of Mister Odinga, was vying for a part leader position against Mister Odinga, a situation which seemed to displease some of the die-hard followers of the former Prime Minister in the past regime.
the criticism towards Arati suggests that the situation was not calm in the event and such a fate would have followed all those who were thought to be in support of the wing that did not seem to be favorable to Mister Odinga.
the plot and that's why after the violence broke out, rumors has it that Mister Odinga was well acquainted with the "Men In Black" plot because some of them have been seen to give him protection at his political meetings.
it was reported that those thugs were hired to disrupt that exercise if the side that Odinga supported was seen to be losing.
all the signs indicated the group for Namwamba and Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho would have floored that of nominated Senator Agnes Zani with Homa Bay Senator the late Otieno Kajwang'.
during the campaigns analysts said that Odinga was supporting Doctor Zani camp who was vying for the secretary general position.
this is due to the step for the supporters of the site, Mathalan, the late Kajwang' said that Ababu was bark and black (Mole) and the ruling party Jubilee.
campaign was thought for Jubilee was the one sponsoring Namwamba campaign, where he use helicopter to move around all over the strong hold for ODM looking for votes.
ODM has established a committee to investigate those chaos while police also have started their parallel investigations.
the results for that investigation were not released to the public up to now the root of those who participated in that act of shame has not been known.
later Mister Odinga started a plan to bring together those two parties by selecting Namwamba and Zani to be the secretary general of the party.
finally, in November he appointed new leaders of the party with Namwamba as the secretary general and Doctor Zani as one of his assistants, another was nominated Senator Miss Elizabeth Ongoro.

he ordered that if electricity will not be supplied he should be given a call in order to hold responsible the manager and the contractor in charge of the work.
Doctor Kalemani said it was sad to see the people spend many expenses following the services at TANESCO offices while they are customers who should be given the service to their place.
"I am saying from now on, I don't want the citizens to follow you in your offices, open branches in the villages so that the citizens can access easily because it's annoying, this citizen gets money in difficulty, and then incurs the cost of following you in your offices"
"and when they come sometimes, they do not find you, you are on lunch break and they go without getting the service, I do not want to hear this and if you do not do this, citizen give me the information I fire someone," said Doctor Kalemani.
in addition, he ordered an agent under the Rural Energy Agency (REA) in Simanjiro district, Yared Zhang of Consolidated Contractors Company CCC Nigeria, to pay staff who assisted him to supply electrical appliances in rural areas, their money which at the moment is 13 million shillings before 30th September this year and if they are not paid by that day he is to be informed.
regarding technicians who install electrical cables in the house, he ordered them to be the ones given letters by Tanzania Electrical Supply Company Limited and not fakes, so that when the houses burn the people to know that they are owed by the organization and not otherwise.
he also used the opportunity to award two elderly men, Elias Lukumay of the Kilombero village and Looki Kimbele of the Losinyai village, a special device called Umeta, which does not need to install electrical cables inside for electrical integration, but itself enough for a house to install electricity.
"but others to buy the equipment at 36,000 shillings, I pray that even grass houses will be connected with electricity, the aim is for everybody to get electricity," he said.
Simanjiro District Commissioner, Zephania Chaula said if the people fail to get electricity in the second phase of REA, they shouldn't complain as they will get it in the third phase.
Simanjiro member of parliament, James Ole Millya, thanked the deputy minister for visiting and quickening electrification, but he urged the TANESCO staff to distribute electricity to religious institutions and schools, as well as Chadema cadres, as some of them were discriminated against.

Minister of Information, Tourism and Sports Rashid Ali Juma said these while speaking to HabariLeo about ministry's plans to strengthen the tourism sector as well as advertising it in new markets.
while explaining, he said in the year 2014, Zanzibar managed to receive a total of 311,801 who visit various areas including the old town of Zanzibar.

technology will take our jobs and if we want it will make them.
it is possible I am the only one who hasn't heard of the government's efforts to cultivate friendly working conditions when we get to the world which everything will be run by machines.
two years ago, I heard our neighbors Kenya are designing a technology village for the purpose of getting ready for the new world of technology.
we have heard our colleagues Rwanda, have made the laptops that they are using themselves.
what about us?
technology is taking people's careers and it is not a joke.
I remember approximately eight years ago when I was joining this company, there were many workers.
the newsroom was filled up with especially people.
it is like half of those people are not at work but the newspaper comes out with a high quality standard.
many positions have been taken up by technology from writing up to the arrangement of pages.
I don't even want to talk about publishing.
those who started writing in the previous years know how the queue to get the newspaper out used to be long.
these news were written on paper, then typed on a type writer and went on to land on the newspaper page.
these days it isn't a must to write even on the computer, a writer can remove their cell phone wherever they are and send news directly to the newsroom.
how many people have lost jobs here?
undoubtedly very many because their positions have been taken up by the machine.
the work that was being done by four people is now being done by one person.
but we should ask ourselves how technology is taking our jobs then we will get a solution to generate other jobs.
I know technology is taking our jobs by making them easy.
it's not like that job gets rid off, but it gets simplified by the machine.
therefore maybe if you decide to find the solutions to the problems we have you can create jobs for yourself by inventing a certain technology.
for example, there are farms that are being cultivated by tractors that are being driven by a machine and not people.
this means, the farming is there and will continue to be present, only that what will avail jobs is inventing technology that will create jobs for the next 20 years.
our jobs will be available if we will arise to invent our own technologies to simplify our troubles.
invention will employ us and make for us guaranteed income in future.
if we wait for technology to be brought to us from abroad.
we will employ experts from abroad because they will be the ones who will have the knowledge.
we have become people of 'quick quick' we shall be taught 'to be clever' September 14, 2012.
many agree that it's not good to be in a state of inferiority as a result of the smallness of a nation in a big country.
it's not good that the country has everything to make it develop into a great nation but its shying and portraying itself like a country with small numbers of people when small countries that have no resources like those look like great countries.
resources are in many forms and the uses can vary from country to country.
creativity in the use of the resources is what differentiates among countries with few resources but are developed and countries with more resources but they don't have that development.
I have been giving an example of success that Kenyans attain in sports (like the recent Olympics) while we have communities of individuals who resemble Kenyans and who live in similar environments to those of the Kenyan champions.
what contributes up to we don't do good is foolishness, confusion, corruption and not worrying anything together with the one of personal benefit.
I will give two or three examples concerning games, having faith that the foundation of progress is the same, either in games, to cultivate a vegetable garden or to prepare the experts of medicine.
the law is all the same.
I've ever been an officer in the games department in the government.
when I was joining the department I was very lucky to receive various youth (the likes of Matoke, the late Masanja et cetera) who had come from Cuba with good degrees in science and sports management.
I got a chance to learn a lot from them, showing content of the the curriculum that they had gone through.
there is no meaning to what they had taught me and other things in the life of a person or community: a must to start with young children while in the nursery by giving them early education and nurturing them slowly while getting used to their bodies and going on to develop physically and mentally.
it is a must to have acceptable teachers in the concerned stages, even if their knowledge is very basic, but there should be highly knowledgeable teachers as the classes climb and the children grow, until university, in the army and at work places and neighborhood.
there is need to invest and follow every step and evaluate the results now and then.
there must be enough pitches because of the daily exercises in the streets, schools, industries, army, villages et cetera.
it's a must to build a society that loves sports, a society of people who love to play games and body exercises.
such a society will support efforts of growing and parenting children in sports because this also has its own financial and time costs.
during the interview of the KITIMOTO program, I encountered fans who came from Saigon who had come to the studio to say the same nonsense: bring a European coach, put the youth in the camps for six months, we shall beat these Ugandans and Kenyans without any problem, then we're going to play the world cup.
what I was advising was that, we don't have an option but to make arrangements at different levels starting with the five-year-old children and move forward as we progress with age (U-14, U-17, U-21 and others) by putting in place various levels until they become adults, we invest tirelessly hoping that the youth we started with at the age of five will be 20 years after 15 years, and these should be the hope for going to the World Cup.
the Saigon fans shouted: who should wait for 15 years, sir?
you bring a white coach, place the boys in the camp, amazingly, they have forgotten that we have had white coaches (the likes of Celebic, Trautmann, Hudson et cetera) who didn't give as results such as Marijani Shaaban, Paul West Gwivaha and Joel Bendera.
remembrance many times get lost from people who don't bother looking for them.
another occasion was when I attended an international conference in one of the European nations accompanied by one of my superiors.
I found (or I thought I had found) the chance to meet and get acquainted with Charles Mukora, chairman of the Kenya Sports Council.
I asked him to allow me to send sports operators (coaches, administrator's, sports therapists et cetera) in his country to learn what Kenyans do that we do not do so we can succeed as they do because I did not see (and today still do not see) why they should succeed and we shouldn't.
Mukora received my request well and told me he would be ready to receive a delegation of 100 players, and he would distribute them in several areas for a period of one month so that they can see for themselves how Kenyans seek for, prepare and develop the talents of their players.
I returned to inform my boss on the agreement and I wanted to introduce him also to Mukora.
the answer from my boss was: You!
what will your people from Kenya offer you, aren't they poor like us?
find people from Europe who are wealthy, not those Kenyans, they are like us.
I give these examples as an illustration of the small capacity to think when discussing various issues, including sports.
sports often captures fan's emotions who more often believe that they are sports professionals but they are only fans.
when we want to develop games on fanaticism, we don't succeed because we think of highlights such as a foreign coach and a lot of money without thinking of strict planning and of long term.
when President Jakaya Kikwete asked Leodegar Tenga if he (Kikwete) would bring a foreign coach and pay him, Tenga would take us to Ghana (CAN's championship) and Tenga responded 'yes'.
what we witnessed is fanaticism (by believing that a foreign coach is the solution) and shame for the little (they were forced to agree on what he did not believe because of the television cameras that were gliding.
the new coach came, and the leader paid, but we did not go to Ghana, and it is likely that we will be listening and watching our fellow players as they go to CAN for a long time.
that is where they will meet my Saigon fans and the leaders of the country who believe that things can be done in a hurry and bear fruits when there is no sustainable strategy of advancing step by step.
we have become "fast fast" people and people who are told "be clever" instead of people who are conscious about plans that aim far.
that condition is emerging everywhere, in education (ward schools) agriculture (agriculture first), health (the cup of Loliondo, witchcraft) energy (Net Solution, Richmond), minerals (Barrick, Buzwagi, now gas), quick wealth (killing of albinos) and so forth.
we don't take time to think and we do our things as if we aren't here for a long time coming, but we pass as we are going to another place.
that's why our plans are "fast fast" and these days it has no life more than the remaining years before the coming election.
we have weakened ourselves psychologically such that we've returned to the mental slavery era of believing that without a European we can't do anything meaningful.
in our sensitive departments, it's seen children of the Europeans with faces showing they've not completed school well, that they call them CTA (Chief Technical Advisor) whose work is to advise our officers who worked for three decades and they've learned in schools that those kids have never dreamed they'll learn from.
this is how they provide guidelines from the world bank, IMF and other seniors who we call financiers, and our administrators receive it and implement.
these are the European coaches in the state operations.
in this way we have embarrassed ourselves, and we are continuing to embarrass ourselves.
in this manner we have given our resources to the whites because they're the ones that have all the brains and and we have carried heads to grow hair like one of the hair breeders said.
through this capital we are not going anywhere because of the development and we will remain as a big country in which every person looks only to see a small nation.
who and who have secret accounts outside and why?
June 28, 2012
among friends whom I'll never leave, is lawyer Enrico Monfrini.
this is not just a skillful lawyer, but he is also a hunter.
his work is to trace stolen money especially by dictatorial leaders and kept in secret accounts outside their countries.
I came to be acquainted with Monfrini in the year 1999 when he got employed by the Nigerian government, to search for and reveal the funds that General Sani Abacha had transferred and hidden in foreign banks.
I was introduced to him by my one big and best Nigerian friend, who had met with Monfrini late in the night in Geneva town and requested him to help Nigeria find out the 'looting' by Abacha.
Abacha who died on June the year 1998 had two major attributes: first, he was a dictator and second, he was one of the richest tycoons in Africa.
but he got his wealth through illegal means in the 1990's when he was Nigeria's military ruler.
Abacha was quick to embezzle from the treasury of Nigeria and steal from his fellow Nigerians.
even though people knew he had the wealth, no one exactly knew how much money he had and where he kept them.
hence immediately after Abacha died, the Nigerian government approached Monfrini to help it search and recover the funds to the government treasury of Nigeria.
I am very lucky to know and plan friendship with Monfrini who now is aged 67 years.
he is gentle, methodical, humorous and is not someone with the selfishness of hiding from his friend concerning what he knows.
it is his hospitality that attracted me to him and it indeed helped me when I was writing various articles about Sani Abacha's theft and how Monfrini managed to search for approximately two billion US dollars hid by Abacha in foreign accounts.
out of that, Monfrini has until now helped recover one point three billion dollars to Nigeria's treasury.
Monfrini has also been attending to financial reserves and other resources of 'Baby Doc' Duvalier, former Haiti ruler who has been accused of corruption and extravagance when he was in leadership in the years of 1970 to 1980.
at the moment, Monfrini has been employed by the new Tunisian government to trace the wealth of the toppled President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali together with that of his wife Leila Trabelsi and their relatives.
it is estimated that the value of their money and other wealth isn't less than billions of American dollars.
until now, Monfrini has succeeded in finding the money less one hundred million American dollars.
but he is still proceeding with his investigation and he says that he is confident of revealing much more.
the biggest problem that Monfrini is getting is the lack of genuine cooperation from banks and even some governments of the western countries, in taking the 'dirty' money of the corrupt and returning them to the treasury of the concerned country.
I know the challenge that Monfrini was going through when he wanted the British government to assist him.
he has been going to London for a period of approximately six years, knocking at the offices of the concerned executives requesting them to assist him.
welcoming and listening to him in a civilized manner, but mostly leaving with nothing.
when lucky, he could be given reports that had no value to his investigation.
the French government on its side remained silent and did not hand him even a single document to help in his endeavors.
one time Monfrini went to Luxembourg believing that Abacha had hid money of the sum of 30 million dollars there.
when he started doing his investigations he came to realize that the amount of money Abacha had in Luxembourg is more than 30 million dollars, he had 650 million dollars.
out of that, 400 million dollars are still remaining in Luxembourg.
Monfrini in his investigation has realized that Abacha had hidden around 221 million dollars in three accounts that are in the banks, in the country of Liechtenstein in Central Europe.
the case of requiring those funds to be returned to Nigeria has been going on for a period of 12 years, and even after the court ordered that those funds be returned to Nigeria, they were still in those accounts.
all these demonstrate the hypocrisy of the government and financial institutions of the western countries that claim to fight against corruption while helping corrupt individuals hide the fruits of their corruption in banks of those same countries of the West.
western nations are daring to continue being an obstacle to fighting corruption despite those United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) that became operational in December 2005.
countries that acknowledged those conventions and appended their signatures are required to have legal frameworks that will be in a position to identify and forbid corruption and also provide international cooperation guidelines that will make it possible for funds stolen and deposited in foreign banks to be refunded back.
unfortunately, these anti-corruption laws are weak in many countries and that weakness is what enables the corrupt people to transfer the stolen funds to foreign banks.
that weakness also enables them undertake in money laundry and use it to buy mansions or in business in foreign countries.
the report that was released last week by the Central Bank of Switzerland (SNB) that clearly showed that residents of East Africa have funds reaching one point three billion dollars in secret accounts in the banks of that country was not surprising.
what we didn't know was the amount of those funds and the owner.
and until now no one knows how those colleagues have gotten all that money and why they decided to deposit them in secret accounts in diaspora banks.
according to that SNB's report, the owners of those accounts from Kenya have surpassed their fellow counterparts from the other countries in this region.
they have a total of 857 million dollars, followed by their Tanzanian counterparts with 178 million dollars, the Ugandans have 159 million dollars, the Rwandese with 29.7 million dollars and the Burundians with 16.7 million dollars.
SNB did not say that the funds were generated through corrupt ways but that is what many people believe.
the question being asked is, why are those people depositing the funds in secret accounts?
we know according to the information we are receiving that is that the Tanzanians with those secret accounts are politicians and businesspersons.
the politicians who are purported to have those accounts are veterans in Tanzanian politics.
it is purported that the owners of those accounts are not the ones who deposited those funds in the bank.
and if not them then who deposited on their behalf and with what reasons?
according to the African Union (AU) every year, African countries are losing more than 150 billion dollars, about 25 percent of their country's total revenue as a result of bribery and corruption.
that amount is enormous and its effect is to make products sold in Africa escalate in their prices by approximately 20 percent.
moreover, that corruption scares away those anticipating to invest in Africa and therefore hampering development and making many Africans to languish in poverty.
most of that money that denies African countries the opportunity to overcome poverty are lying in Swiss banks, a country whose rules and regulations concerning banking activities safeguard the corrupt individuals and the monies they acquire through unlawful ways.
in my own understanding, many African politicians who are known they have or had secret accounts in the Swiss banks are those, that come from countries that mine and sell oil or minerals.
that is why their list has names of President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos of Angola, Dennis Sassou-Nguesso of Congo-Brazzaville and Obiang Nguema of Equatorial Guinea.
heads of Elf Aquitaine Oil Company have confessed that they have been depositing for the former President of Gabon Omar Bongo, 50 million dollars every year to one of his secret bank accounts in Switzerland.
those payments were a bribe to Bongo for giving that company the license to mine oil in Gabon.
the government of Switzerland did not say anything about, that and as it appears is that Gabon will not succeed in recovering those funds that will help the country to fight with challenges of bringing development.
it maybe also be a challenge to the government of Gabon to criticize Omar Bongo because the government currently being run by President Ali Bongo, who is his son.
it is estimated that, Swiss banks have 35 percent of all the savings deposited in the banks of the world.
that is a very huge sum of money.
among the owners of those accounts are: presidents, prime ministers, legitimate traders, thugs and drug traffickers.
the rules and regulations that allow banks of that country to run their activities in secrecy are troubling even the big nations like America and Britain that try to bar funds acquired through unlawful ways or that are used in illegal activities such as terrorism from entering the banking system.
the greatest victims from these activities of the Swiss banks are countries like ours that lack clean water, adequate schools, required facilities in our hospitals, accessible roads, electricity and agricultural development techniques.
the funds that could have helped to rescue our countries from these challenges have been stolen and deposited in Swiss banks.
the Tanzanian government is responsible for taking legal action and with urgency so that we are able to know it's the likes of who deposited funds in those secret accounts and for what reasons.
we must identify those individuals as enemies of the country and if there is evidence for that, then strict legal action to be taken against them.
a form four student at Mbeya collectively beaten by teachers.
Rashid Mkwinda
her clothes torn,
a male teacher put his fingers in her private parts
acts of sexual violence and violence against girls have become increasingly common in the presence of institutions for the protection of women's rights and the establishment of gender gadgets in the country's police centers.
a 17-year-old girl, (name withheld) studying at Kata secondary school in Mbeya has been confronted and her inner clothes torn and punished severely by four teachers of the school.
the incident reported in a small police station at Mbalizi in Mbeya by the investigations book number MBI/IR/967/2016 and placed on notice number MBI/R/2653/2016 report is reported to involve four teachers including the head of the school and three teachers.
speaking while in great pain at the Special Hospital of Ifisi where she was hospitalized for treatment, the student said she was called by the disciplinary teacher who she mentioned by the name of Neema Mwaikenda who was with the head of the school who she mentioned by the name of Mariamu Mwanisenga and a male teacher who she mentioned by the name the name of Adili.
she said the teachers began punishing her with lots of canes while ripping her clothes when a male teacher in the name of Adili began to seize her private parts.
'when I was being punished by all the teachers, this male teacher started touching me down there, asking me to mention my men, as I had my legs together they went on attacking me with canes and kicks and sticks,' said the student.
she said the reasons she was being punished was skipping school and one day when she was at school she was shown by the teachers sticks and told that the sticks would end in her body and she was afraid to come to school for three days.
she explains that she had come to school where she was met with the occurrence of being beaten by four teachers until she broke loose from the teachers and ran to the street and hid.
"I broke loose from the teachers and fled to a house neighboring the school hiding till late and later went home, the following day my mother and sister later took me and brought me to the hospital," she said.
the journalist came to the school where the student studies for the purpose of meeting the school's leadership where the deputy of the school in the same name of Mwansanga refused to explain anything.
"I do not know anything first, I am not the school spokesman, so I do not know anything about the information you need," replied the deputy of the school and left.
according to the Regional Education Officer Charles Mwakalila, the punishment given to the student is serious since there are disciplinary proceedings that a student should be beaten with three strokes and no more than six strokes or alternatives.
"the punishment given to her was great, we will follow up and the violators will receive disciplinary action," said Mwakalila.
the Police Commander of Mbeya District Dhahiri Kidavashari when he was asked about the incident he claimed it had not reached his office and that he was currently active in the Chunya District and when he arrives at the office he would follow and take legal steps to the parties.
earlier, Mbeya Regional Administrator Secretary Mariamu Mtunguja who arrived at the hospital where the student was hospitalized said she had looked at the student and saw how blood was lying on her hips and thighs.
Mtunguja said that the act done by these teachers is unkind that should not be tolerated and that once it is confirmed he will ensure that disciplinary action is taken on the teachers.
the Nursing Assistant at Ifisi Special Hospital Elimati Sanga said the student was taken to hospital on July 21 at 7:00 am where she was treated and admitted due to injuries and bleeding disorders in the hips and thighs.
'she has been attacked on her thighs, her blood and her ears are not good enough because of the strokes, she continues with the treatment here in the hospital,' said Sanga.
I'm afraid he will use then dump me.
I have a lover whom I've known for several weeks now.
we made love the second week after knowing each other claiming that is the only way to show we love each other.
now he wants us to continue but I am afraid he will use and then dump me.
I don't want and I'm still a student.
advise me.
via SMS, his allegations that making love is the only way to show that people love each other is a total lie.
don't agree again since you're still a student and he can impregnate you and then dump you.
he has another one: there is a guy who we are in love but I hear people saying that he has another girl.
advise me.
hearsay can be true or untrue.
investigate those reports until you confirm.
if you realize it's true, leave him since that shows that he isn't faithful to you.

oppressive militia police to suffer consequences
written by Eric Anthony, Dodoma.
printed 08 September 2016
the government has emphasized that it won't hesitate to take action against militia police officers who will be found taking part in oppressive actions on feeder women and other business people, expressed that such actions are contrary to the law.
moreover, it has advised business people to do their activities in the officially designated areas by the committee in order to avoid friction with the concerned authorities.
the minister for the state, in the office of the president (Tamisemi), Selemani Jafo, has given that position in parliament today in Dodoma when he was answering a question from the special seat parliamentarian, Zianab Vullu (CCM), who wanted to know the government's strategies to prepare a good business environment for feeding mothers to protect them from harassment by militia police in all towns in the country.
in her question, she said that more than 30 per cent of the urban residents get their breakfast, lunch and even supper from these feeding mothers, but these important service providers find themselves harassed every day.
Jafo said that the government recognizes and values the great contribution from small scale business people who are in this informal sector in growing income and creating employment.
in regard to this importance, all authorities have been directed to ensure they set aside areas for these small scale business people, including feeding mothers, close to where the customers are.
speaking about militia oppression, he said whatever they are doing is contrary to the 1969's law of assistant police that bars them from beating up, taking or destroying citizen's items or property.
he insisted that militia police, as it is to other public servants, are supposed to follow the law, principles and procedures without oppression or abuse whenever they are removing business people from places they are not allowed to operate from.

lady refuses boyfriend to be shaved by a woman
by Lewa Jefa
a lady from this neighborhood caused a stir when she invaded a barber shop and chased out her lover who had gone to get a shave, claiming that the place was full of ladies who seduced men in the pretense of massaging their heads after being shaved.
we are informed that in that place there is a section where customers are shaved and another where their heads are washed and massaged.
according to our informant, all barbers in that room are male youth but those who wash and massage customers are beautiful ladies who only wear bras and shorts.
to get shaved "it is very rare to find the place without customers because every time men flock there to get services and others to stare at the beautiful ladies as they work," said the informant.
on the day of the incident, the lady arrived there noisily and found her boyfriend in the process of being shaved.
"she started yelling at him and called him a lady in public, for falling into the beautiful ladies trap.
the staff and the supervisors of the place were forced to take immediate action to avoid more drama in fear of being muddled by that lady and told her to stop spreading gossip about their business," said the informer.
khanga is the national garment
written by Angela Semaya, Dodoma.
published: 7 September 2016
the Minister for news, culture, art, and sports, Nape Nnauye has said if the national garment process would have continued, it was heading to the finding of the garment of a leader different from expectation.
in avoiding that, the government gave an appeal the khanga dress be used to identify as a national dress after being seen to be liked to be used by many people.
Nape spoke in the parliament yesterday that Tanzania has 126 tribes in which each tribe has its own culture and code of dressing and that during the process, the government concluded that it will adopt a common garment rather than a national garment.
"the committee was formulated and the process begun, but Tanzania has 126 tribes later we discovered that we would end up having a leader's dress instead of the national garment... but in the process the khanga was popular and worn by many thus it was selected and given the identity of the national garment.
"even other nations did a process, they liked a certain outfit and made it public," he said.
Minister Nape was responding to the additional question by the special seat parliamentarian Mary Mwanjelwa (CCM), who wished to know how the process of selecting a national garment was finalized.
in another step, Minister Nape called on the community to refuse acts of breaking morals that are being done by artists if together with wearing clothes that have no honor.
he said artists are in the community and so every community member should participate and encourage artists to focus on values.
"artists stay in our community, if society refuses to accept their behavior, they will stop but if they applaud what the artists do then they will see no problem in that," she said.
previously in the primary question, Mwanjelwa said the musicians have been wearing indecent clothes or sometimes a woman's dignity is severely oppressed as a result of wearing clothes that reveal their body shapes and she wanted to know what was the government's plan to control such dressing.
responding to this fundamental question, Nape said the government has been taking disciplinary and legal measures on artists including fining and jailing those who violate ethics by dressing or designing artifacts that violate a woman's personality.
he said starting from the year 2014/2015 until now, three female artists and one male artist in addition to one group of caravan people were given a warning and others were completely closed for humiliating the dignity of a woman.
in addition, he said in 2016/2017 that one male artist was given a warning and fined.
he called on every Tanzanian to ensure in one way or another, they maintain and protect the values and customs of the Tanzanian people.
drunkenness is very bad.
see the story of the daughter of a prominent person who has done a bad thing because of drunkenness: Richard Bukos drunkenness is bad! that's what you can say about what happened to the child of one prominent person who lives in Masaki who found herself injured in the waters of the Indian Ocean in the Coco area of Dar last Saturday.
before that incident, it's claimed that the lady, whose name isn't immediately known, stayed up all night clubbing in one club at the beach with her companions.
when it became morning, it's claimed that, in order to reduce the feeling of drunkenness in her head, she decided to go swimming to feel better.
the source who witnessed the incident spoke to our photographer saying that, at the time the beauty was going to swim that's when she fell into the hands of one giant who was exercising at the corner of the beach where she also met with Azam FC players, who were doing exercises, when things went wrong.
"at the time she followed those players, the Bajaj owners' radios had been switched on playing loud music, she started dancing, when those guys saw it, they increased the volume and put on Davido's song of Aye, what! for her so she got very excited, the way she was gyrating and the clothes she wore, she thoroughly confused Azam players who were looking at her with eyes wide open salivating," said that source.
after having made those players possessed, the lady followed one giant who was aside and begged him to teach her how to swim, the fellow took a car tire and immersed her in the sea where he began with boastfulness to teach her while they dived to show there was a dirty game that was going on.

the street traders and government's conflict is breeding in Mwanza.
August 11th, 2016.
with Christopher Gamaina
Mwanza
there is every sign of an eruption of another big conflict between the street traders and the government if the offices of the provincial head, district and Mwanza city will continue not involving the traders in the plan to remove them from the city center, it has been revealed.
the office of the city council's director has already written a letter to the mayor to notify him that it intends to move the street traders from August 20th this year, under the close supervision of the Mwanza provincial head and Nyamagana district offices.
the letter, witnessed by Good Citizen specifies that the leadership of Mwanza city council is expecting to use 200 million shillings to effect the activities to remove the street traders from the city center to the side areas that are in Mirongo Community Center and Sinai Mabatini.
the street traders being affected by that move believed to be a legal order by the Mwanza provincial head John Mongella and the Nyamagana district head Mary Tesha, are the ones trading in Makoroboi, Sahara and Tanganyika stand areas.
for now, the office of the city council's director recognizes those areas as unofficial for street traders activities, therefore the procedure to move them will be executed quickly by using police officers, the military and various officers of the city.
the letter from the Acting Director of the City Council Hosiana Kusiga to the city's Mayor James Bwire insists that, the plan to move those street traders is an execution of the law and regulations of city operations in Tanzania as follows:
the local government rules for the city authorities on cities' operations of the year 2008, the by-laws on the environmental sanitation of Mwanza city of the year 2010, the law on the city outlook planning number 8/2007 and the environmental law number 25/1972.
street traders complain
the street traders' leaders have denied receiving the report on being moved on August 20th this year saying they are also hearing of it from other people in the streets, therefore they are not working on it.
I have no information whatsoever, it's just superficial information.
"we have not been involved in that and I have no official report from the city director," said the chairman of the street traders union Mwanza province, Matondo Masanja, during an interview with Raia Mwema here in the city, towards the end of last week.
he added that his assistants and himself were advised that there was a sitting for provincial, district and city leaders discussing the issues of street traders at the city hall last Friday, but they were blocked from going in when they followed up to find out what was going on.
however, it is alleged that the mediation of relocating the street traders was not arrived at during the meeting, it was therefore postponed to last Tuesday for measures to bless the implementation of the program.
secretary general of Shiuma Venatusi Anatori, said he had no official information about the issue, but he had started working together with other officials to follow up on the matter from the respective office.
"we are planning for the purpose of following up on the report with the city's director, because our members (street traders) have begun asking us about the transfer but we still have no answer," said Anatori and added:
"we (union and the street traders) are not opposed to be moved and what they want to do without involving us is cruel.
we knew that those who were being moved were street traders, but those are others are just hearsay, we won't act on them.
on the other side, the union leaders and other traders who spoke to this newspaper have questioned the reasons for wanting to suddenly remove them from the areas handed to them by the Mwanza city council without even involving them.
they have also complained about the move by every leader transferred to the city here, to start looking at their activities with so much force that they claim is weakening them in earnings as a result of being moved to the side areas that are not accessible to many customers.
the director speaks
when asked about that issue, the Mwanza city council's director Kiomoni Kibamba said that decision to move the street traders is a valid order by the head of Nyamagana district and that the records in his office show that those traders were involved in the planning.
"I am on a journey but I have been told that there were sittings concerning the matter and the street traders were involved, that is a valid order by the district head, the rest of us are implementers," said Kibamba over the telephone.
additionally, he said that the other reports he has are that some of the street traders required to be moved had been allocated space at the Mirongo Community Center and Sinai Mabatini areas in the previous years, but they later on sold them and returned to the city center.
they (street traders) should agree to the change to move to the new areas, the customers will follow them there.
"what I understand is that they have been involved even in the sittings of the council of councilors of the Mwanza city council," insisted the director who was recently handed the authority.
Diallo mentions the problems that are chewing CCM
August 18, 2016.
Mwanza - while the CCM chairman Doctor John Magufuli is waited on to start "puncturing boils" that are weakening the party economically, the chairman of Mwanza province, Doctor Anthony Diallo has come out to mention the supervisors of that evil to be executives, especially secretaries that employed in the party.
that statement by Diallo has been supported by a number of his colleagues including the chairman of the CCM Projects Committee of Mwanza Province, Ally Hamis Mambile and party's secretary Charles Masalakulangwa, who have advised that the employment system and titles in the party to be revised to improve on revenue and financial spending.
speaking to Raia Mwema in Mwanza last weekend, being two days after President Magufuli had finalize his tour here in the province, the delegates have predicted a hard task awaiting the chairman in cleaning up the ruling party from harboring many leaders who are not patriots and honest.
CCM Mwanza province owns several buildings that is renting out to various businesspersons, but the revenues collected from the projects are purported to have been misappropriated by few directors to the extend of failing to expand the investment by starting new projects.
some of those buildings include a five story building that houses CCM's regional headquarter that generates for the party revenue of 31 million shillings every month, CCM Kirumba that generates 35 million shillings and Tunakopesha that generates five million shillings per month, according to the chairman of projects, Mambile.
Doctor Diallo has been mentioned to have visions of strengthening the party by increasing economic projects but his ambition has been disrupted by his secretary's office mandated to manage utilization of the revenues collected.
without hesitation, he has openly mentioned that many CCM secretaries at regional and district levels are the wizards of the economy of the party, hence he wishes to see the wrath of Doctor Magufuli landing on them without mercy for the benefit of the citizens.
"often the embezzlers of the party's revenues are the greedy secretaries enrolled at the regions and districts from the headquarters (office of the secretary general that employs them), even here (Mwanza) financial matters have not been good," he said.
on his part, Mambile who is also a member of the regional political committee has explained his dissatisfaction with the system that denies those committees authority to take disciplinary actions against executives who misuse the funds of the party.
"the political committee has no authority to take action against an executive who steals the party's funds, the only leader with those powers is the secretary general," said Mambile and continued:
"the political committee should be given teeth to discipline the embezzlers since it is the one that goes through the reports of the party, it should be authorized to take direct actions even if it's suspending incompetent executives."
but on the other hand, he said, little understanding concerning of performance issues to some of the elected leaders has been contributing to giving an opening to unethical executives to benefit from party funds.
and a famous cadre and founder of CCM Masalakulangwa, believes that the foundation of patriotism in the party began wavering after the introduction of multi-party system in the country in the year 1992, that allowed wealthy businesspersons to be given leadership in the party for fearing being ejected from power.
"CCM was a solid party for farmers and businesspersons in the era of Julius (father of the nation, teacher Nyerere), but it began wavering in the year 1992, I believe it was threatened by the power of multi-party and started looking for the affluent to be given the leadership even if he doesn't have the ability to lead and left out competent individuals."
"since that time it tolerated bribes from the opinion polls to the general election and overlooked the candidate's reputation."
until now there is a possibility that there is no leader in CCM and if present they are few like Magufuli who did not bribe.
"that is why I say, if it's removing the names of bribe givers, Magufuli will eliminate them amicably through his powers as the chairman of CCM because most of them don't know how to ask for votes without bribing, even the voters are accustomed to being bribed."
but I'm very confident with Doctor Magufuli.
I believe he can restore this party to the strong foundation that had been established by Julius Nyerere if he will get good cooperation from party members with genuine patriotism.
during Nyerere's era, individuals were not going to seek wealth in the party.
but these days, almost every young person that we employ in the party come to look for money.
it's him first, party later.
that is why it has become poor and a beggar," explained Masalakulangwa, who also got to be the party's treasurer, Mwanza province for 10 consecutive years (1992-2002).

the UN and EU Conducting Campaigns for Understanding of Sustainable Developmental Goals
the European Union (EU) and United Nations (UN) have come together to drive a campaign for understanding of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) in Tanzania.
moreover, together they have also toured projects funded by the EU.
while in the region of Iringa, they had an opportunity to speak to 1,000 university students from Iringa and Mkwawa universities in a seminar that explained these global goals which are part of the 2030 agenda of the global sustainable development goals.
this campaign targets making the youth understand 17 global goals which were set a year ago and inform them their responsibilities in their successful implementation in the Tanzanian environment.
the seminar in those universities is part of a firm plan by the United Nations which was launched in Arusha in May of this year by United Nations Agencies Coordinator Mister Alvaro Rodriguez, which aims at educating more than 30,000 youths about the global goals by next year.
the EU and UN delegation also got an opportunity to visit various projects that are supported by the EU including a German homestead that was renovated with support from the EU through 'our pride: southern highlands culture solutions'.
this homestead is one of the old buildings in Iringa and was built by Germans in 1900 as a military hospital.
after the First World War, the building's usage was changed by the new rulers, the English, and turned it into an administrative building.
the EU has said it takes pride in being one of the biggest investors in the arts and cultural heritage sector in Tanzania, supporting 10 projects which are under the 10 EDF programs to help cultural issues.
issues that relate to cultural heritage are important in enhancing economic and employment growth while fostering community relations and giving an opportunity to the improvement of developmental tourism in Iringa while bringing benefits to the region's residents.
Mister Rodriguez, while speaking at the campaign said that agenda 2030, which is a developmental agenda, needs everyone's cooperation.
he praised the students and intellectuals for holding firmly in realizing those global goals.
moreover, he touched on the importance of the youth's participation in development issues due to the fact that in a nation like Tanzania the youth make up 60 per cent of the entire population.
he said that the youth have a huge role in participating in those developments with the aim of taking the country to another step of development.
however, he said that it is everyone's responsibility, and especially the youths to ensure that these global goals are achieved.
he said the United Nations, with the help of its important partners such as the European Union, will continue helping Tanzanians to take part in various development activities in supporting those global goals.
one of the participants praised the United Nations for reaching out to the youth in universities and giving them that seminar.
I feel like a lucky person to get an opportunity to learn sustainable development from the United Nations Agencies Coordinator in the country.
as a youth, I am comforted to see that our leaders are following the directions defined in the 17 sustainable development goals, I believe that if we work hard to reach them by 2030, then Tanzania and the world as a whole will be a better place to live.
"and because I now know about these global goals, I can give my contribution to help achieve them. I feel very enabled," said Mary, one of the participants.
understand the behavior of men who have artistic love.
in the daily love life, there are those who are pained time and again and complain as if love wasn't made to be enjoyable but painful and just blamable for them.
unfortunately, many who are in this group are the female gender.
many have significantly been combated by these troubles because of not understanding some of the behaviors of the second gender which largely seems to every time hurt the others.
this painful and deception situation in love is there for all who are in marriage and unfortunately many have decided to simplify it by finding comfort on the side.
this condition has really degraded the value of those in these marriages. these days, they call them "MBA" and this is not masters in business administration but "married but available" meaning he or she is married but available any time you need a lover.
many are just in marriages these days so as to protect respect and avoid the disgrace of divorce while love to them already became open business.
Alexander, an American relationships expert when interviewed by the CNN television station revealed that, women are the ones who seemed to have many relationships outside than men and the difference present between them and the men suffering is that, they are experts in keeping secrets of what is happening.
meaning that, it is easy to catch a man cheating in love than a woman, although it is said that women have a reason for everything they do, different from men who can go outside for love without even a reason.
you will find that every time they are caught, they will have very many reasons to defend themselves, some which are headless and legless.
they become people who hide what they are doing, concealing their deception and striving to control their inner feelings of accusation (guilty) which is caused by the truth that they have a relationship on the side.
in this accusatory feeling, sometimes they become frequently moody or irritated by even small things and quarrel for very common things.
so as to help you, I would like to give you a few traits of men with artistic love.
from the experience I get in handling people's relationships and psychological problems, I have discovered that many targeted by the effects of these behaviors are those who get into or are in relationships with married men.
the first trait:
they are permanently people who really avoid giving or receiving presents. they are clever in a way of convincing you to know that they were created like that, and that they are ready to do bigger things in love but not for presents, but the truth is that they are avoiding conditions which will make them suspicious to their wives or another side lover.
you know in gifts, many things can happen. others have been caught with receipts of purchases made and others have been asked when they bought a shirt. or, how comes I don't know of that perfume, where did it come from?
therefore, be very attentive when you see this sign in your love.

written by our writer
published: 19 September 2016
health stake holders in the country including TMJ have launched the first website for kidney ailment news that is used in the Swahili language.

launching the book, assistant health minister, social development, gender, the elderly and children, Doctor Hamis Kigwagwalla said, "availability of the kidney book and Swahili website, talked about by many people is a great step in prevention and treatment of kidney infections.
TMJ hospital and a team of Doctors have done a great job for the sake of this project for preparing the Swahili kidney book and a website for kidney patients."
he said that a Swahili book and a website about kidney infection will benefit millions of kidney patients and approximately 100 million Swahili users in fighting kidney infection.
Kigwangala said that the book aims at providing basic information to patients and their families about all the kidney problems.
the acting director of TMJ, Doctor Tayabal Jafferjie said the launch of the website will enable Tanzanians to get various information about the infection.
Concerning the book, Doctor Jafferjie said it has 230 pages and it will help kidney patients and other people to get informed of their kidney health and to remove controversy about all kidney problems.

the kidney book and website were first written in English by Doctor Sanjay Pandya from India while the book and the website in Swahili were prepared by Doctor Upanda.
let's stop people's politics and focus on issues.
April 26th, 2015.
one of the things that at times make one lose hope when you follow up on our country's politics, is that we follow people too much.
the biggest fanaticism of following people trouble us because its results are often not good.
the politics of following people are politics that should not continue to be entertained because all the time its results are bad.
the politics of following people follow the fanaticism of a person in another person.
many if not all times, people get attracted to a certain politician or because it is their friend or it is a person who makes them so happy to a point that they are blind to the troubles or weaknesses of that person and to the extent of being ready to accept being led by them, as long as he is their colleague.
these politics do not really care about the issues a person stands for.
one danger that could be massive especially towards the general election is that there are people among us who do not really care what politicians stand for or even investigating what they say they stand for.
these ones will follow a person or they will stand with a person because not standing with them could be problematic.
they don't care about the history of the person and even if they say they care, they don't care about the whole history but the one they like.
its results are that in this election, we might put to authority people who a few weeks later will be the ridicule of the voters.
we've already seen in the last parliament for example, some parliamentarians where a person if forced to ask how they were able to be elected in their counties.
there are some that you could say are like sarcasm to the voters' intelligence, that how drunk were the voters to have elected those they elected.
at times, the answer is very easy, they elected them because they liked them.
they didn't care if they were good leaders or not.
what they cared about was that not electing them would have been viewed as betraying them.
its results are that politicians and especially those who want to contest for leadership positions know our weakness, and therefore do not care to talk about policies or issues more and instead they will come with arguments that talk about people.
for example, people are opposing CCM not because they know what CCM stands for but they are opposing CCM because they just do not like the CCM members.
and some might dislike some of the CCM members and therefore hate all CCM members.
this is true even on another side.
there are people who dislike Chadema not because of the issues it stands for but they dislike it because they do not like the people inside that party.
and you might see this even with CUF, ACT Patriots or other political parties.
its results are that our politics are very fanatical on people.
if a politician leaves or makes a certain decision, we do not really care if it is the right decision or not but because it is a person we like so much, we find ourselves forced to support him because not doing so amounts to not being our colleague.
its danger is that we start making up a "peoples' following" instead of the following of issues.
these kind of politics are very dangerous.
they are dangerous because if that person changes their stand then we are also forced to change our stand or to agree with his stand because if we go against him, it is easy to be seen as not supporting the person.
these kinds of politics all the time have very bad results. they have bad results because if we do not stand for the principles or issues which show how we stand for principles and therefore decide to follow people, then we can find ourselves being tossed around like cone.
take for example a politician stands and says something which we agree with him then later on changes about the same thing. should we also change? some are forced to change because they agree with those changes or others change because if they do not change, they will find themselves colliding with the earlier agreement.
this is very important to think of especially when it comes to the issue of presidential candidates.
for what particular reasons are we supporting certain contestants?
do we know what they stand for?
what do they stand for?
we support others because they are opposing a certain contestant, is this a reason enough to support them?
or should we support those we agree with but in doing so we oppose others just because they are supporting others?
can we be able to support people on issues without being hateful (and this is a major result of the politics of following people) of those we are not supporting?
I say it is a major result because, instead of taking what we are doing as politics, we have started agreeing with one of the totally dangerous norms, brewing hate.
if we don't agree or if I don't support you then it means I hate you.
is it a must to be like that?
it is bad luck that we have not yet found a good cure for this crisis.

with Anthony Ishengoma
the government is preparing to employ 5,554 experts of community development for the period of five years so that they an provide service to the community development starting from the high level of the government to the rural they way it is in the administration first in the country.
while giving a speech during the sixth graduation of the Institution of the Community Development, Tenguru outside the city of Arusha, the Deputy of the Minister of the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, the elderly and children, Hamis Kigwangalla has said the government of the first phase had a big population of women and men of community development in every ward.
he added that for now the experts in the community development sector have started to reduce extremely and he wanted that institution to add more students to work on the purpose of the government of having experts in every district and ward.
however, he wanted the Institution of Community Development, Tengeru to continue providing a profession that has quality standards and should be considered during the process of providing education starting with qualified students who deserve and the criteria that will build the community of readers who are productive in our nation.
he said the country will change very much and there will be development if the professionals of this country will love their country the way everybody loves their mother and send themselves in the performance of the job it will go together with the wisdom of here it is work.
and the head of the Institution of the Community Development, Tengeru, Anatory Bunduki, while he gave a speech to those graduates he said together with the strategies that are there to improve that Institution, for now it has started a national center of research and conservation of posts of women in the country, the center has began by collaboration with UNESCO and UNFPA together with the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children.

the sixth graduation of the Institution of Community Development, Tengeru it has produced successful graduates of diploma, the first certificate and the diploma of masters of community development.
a few years ago, during the former forth term government, there's one thing that really shocked me.
that thing concerned a minister of that government and a bank guard.
what happened is that the honorable minister had gone to the money dispensing machine, famous as ATM, maybe for the sake of withdrawing money.
while inside that room, he started speaking on phone.
he spoke on phone for a long time, a situation that made the customers who were waiting for that service to start complaining, forcing the guard to request the minister to step aside for the other customers to access the service.
that didn't please the minister and he instead started asking the guard if he knew who he was, because he as a minister had many important matters and he was having a very important phone call.
for that minister, the issue of talking inside the ATM room and denying other customers like him a chance to access the service they needed for a time wasn't a big deal at all.
the honorable minister and the bank guard saga was reported in the press and unfortunately its end was saddening, because the bank guard was fired due to executing his duties.
some of the people made noise but there's nothing that happened.
mostly, someone's dad was left without a job while wondering how to take care of his family that depended on him.
now the other day that situation repeated itself again.
this time round however, it involved the wife to another honorable minister who argued with a traffic officer executing his official duties for explaining the traffic offenses she had committed.
instead of listening to her offenses and get punished in accordance to her actions, this wife used her card of going through her husband's back and made negative annoying sentiments to that officer.
for the first time in a long time, things are heading towards change and those who thought they are above the law are being reminded again that Tanzania is not theirs alone.
reports say that President John Pombe Magufuli has ordered the traffic officer who was doing his job and ended up being insulted by the minister's wife to be promoted.
at the same time, he has warned the minister and his wife from getting involved in that incident, since there is no one who is above the law.
personally, that report has made me very happy.
let's just say that Tanzania was a very strange country.
it had very many classes to a point of people talking about the desire to run to other foreign countries due to feeling undervalued, while others strutted in the neighborhoods dismissing people from work as if they were the valid owners of this country.
Tanzania reached a point where this traffic officer whom the president decided to promote would have been at a very tough state.
first lies would have been placed on him and then he would have been transferred from the work station to a village with a very common unit.
those he annoyed would have ensured that the guy never returns to town again, and he'd totally be forgotten.
but all this is due to the ignorance of certain classes thinking they are above the law and they are untouchable, while we the lows, continue to pay fines lawfully and sometimes getting punished by an officer angered by the mistreatment of the likes of the minister's wife.
shame a wife caught having sex in husband's bedroom
a scuffle has ensued after a man who was mentioned by one name, Samora, caught his wife Hadija live betraying him by breaking the sixth commandment with a lover in the Holy Month of Ramadhan, and in their own bedroom.
news from reliable sources revealed that Samora and Hadija are a couple that got married in the Boma in Magomeni, Dar in 2009 and in their marriage they have been blessed to get one male child.
the act of surprise happened in the Kinondoni-Kwamsisiri region of Dar in the couple's home, around 7pm, July 29, this year.
reports say that at the beginning of this year, the marriage between the two collapsed and degenerated into a disagreement where together with putting things straight they went on fighting every now and then.
it was claimed that the source of conflict between the two arises from the husband suspecting that the wife was cheating.
it is said that later whisperers followed Samora and told him that his wife has been having a love affair with another man out of their wedlock and that is why she has been bringing him trouble.
it went on to be claimed that after the marriage broke, Samora became weak and depressed and thus he had to run away from his matrimonial home and went to live with his parents.
it was said that Samora returned while conducting thorough investigations using neighbors to give him information about every man who entered and went out of his home when he was not present.
Samora's investigation determined that Hadija was playing out their marriage with a man who was identified by one name of Rwekaza who is an employee in the government.
in depth reports said that Samora was informed that the man was moving in a Suzuki Swift 1.3 and some days he would spend the entire night without a bit of shame that Hadija was someone's wife.
after getting this confirmation is when Samora organized himself by getting area youth so that when Rwekaza arrives at the house to sleep with his wife they attack him and do him in.
unaware that he was anxiously being waited for around 7pm, Rwekaza arrived in the home and went straight to the bedroom as he was used to.
while in the bedroom, it is alleged that they went on with their activities while Rwekaza's belly was out and his pants' zipper was undone while Hadija had stripped and was only in her underwear and tied one scarf around her.
in that ambush, Samora stormed into the room accompanied by a group of youths who only had one aim: to harm Rwekaza.
while in the room, there ensued a huge scuffle after Samora witnessed his mate who had taken an oath of never separating from him betraying their love live.
after seeing great pollution in the room, our reporter informed the police from Kwamsisiri Station who arrived in the area to do a good and big work of avoiding trouble or murder because Samora was very angry.
to prove that she was his lawful wife, Samora went into the cupboard and produced their marriage certificate and photographs that were taken on their wedding day showing them with smiles of 'you and I forever' before the devil 'did his' in their Union.
according to the neighbors, the incidence shocked many while believing totally that it is very rare for incidences of ambushes to happen during the fasting period.
surely, even in the Holy month?
it is very shameful for a woman to bring another man into her husband's room.
really, this ambush is really a strike-back," one of the villagers who witnessed the incidence was heard saying shortly after breaking the fast.
he searched a job for me and now am his sex slave.
hi guys, how are you?
it's two months now since I left working in the old company, and now I'm in another company, I was given this new job by my Boss who is the head of our department, I have gotten a promotion a bit, there I was a clerk and here I am supervisor.
now this Boss dropped me at work we have been friends since I entered here, what hurts me it's the behavior of this Boss of mine, I mean I have been like a slave, all the time he wants us to have sex, in the evening when it's time to leave he wants us to remain in his office, I found myself reaching home at nine so finding my mister already back in time, it becomes a quarrel, I have to fool him because the new job has become too demanding in me, I'm late to leave.
weekends it's like that, I have to fool them home that we are needed to work even on Sunday, I find myself living like a slave because of these work that I was given by this Boss, am worried that this words might my Mister it will become a problem.
I wish to go back to my earlier job, this new job pays me a good salary but I'm like a slave, sometimes when I show symptoms of insistence to remain in the evening he becomes harsh and starts to threaten me that "you forget who put you there" I am forced to be intimate with him although I don't like.
I'm asking for advice what should I do?
we have lost an opportunity with Obama
July 05, 2013
finally president Barack Obama has visited Tanzania.
the fact that Obama has an African ancestry makes his visit to some of the countries of this continent to have a unique attraction.
but maybe if we put aside the joy of the visits by the first American president who is black American, and the fact that it is a great occurrence to be visited by a leader of the world super power, it is important to look at other more important matters related to the visit.
maybe before I get deep into this discussion, let me talk about an incident that engulfed me on Twitter.
Monday, just after Obama arrived in Dar, I found myself getting into 'a war of words' with one British Broadcasting Company (BBC) journalist who is a Tanzanian like me.
what caused the war of words is he was angered by my tweets which mostly inclined on looking at heavy matters about the visit instead of the excitement that accompanied it.
for example, I tried to arouse curiosity on how a common Tanzanian will gain from the visit.
again I re-tweeted several tweets from different people who were viewing Obama's visit with a different perspective, particularly in matters of human rights, corruption and many others.
that did not please that gentleman, and he bitterly attacked me, accusing me of lack of patriotism 'I am used by the white' (though he is an employee of a white people company).
anyway, I finally decided to just ignore him for despite of him being a journalist (who was supposed to basically value my freedom of expression), appeared to oppress my constitutional rights to give ideas so long as they don't offend or abuse anyone.
the incident was just one of the ones that accompanied Obama's visit.
the other day, when the leader arrived in Tanzania, at least two great American newspapers - The New York Times and USA Today had heavy news about Tanzania.
those newspapers through their writers who came home to do the coverage of Obama's visit wrote different issues that puts in doubt the image of our country.
depending on the interviews they did with people of different cadres at home, the newspapers talked about the act of hijacking Doctor Ulimboka, the killings of Padre Evaristus Mushi in Zanzibar, Arusha bomb attack and prime minister Mizengo Pinda's opinion to allow police to beat up crooked citizens.
different from those great newspapers in and out of America, most of our newspapers at home (except this profound one) appeared to direct all of their minds to the logistics of Obama's visit, especially on the issue of his security.
trending news on our newspapers about that visit leaned on the number of vehicles on Obama's convoy, planes that came (and their sizes), the number of secret service agents and such like things.
true, Tanzanians were supposed to be informed on how the president of America is guarded, but they would also really wish to know the benefits of the visit to their country.
similarly, the citizens could have been done great service by our newspapers if they emulated New York Times and USA Today for using Obama's visit to inform the world about different matters that bothers us in development, for example corruption, human rights violation and many others.
but we can go far beyond blaming some of our news writers who move around with sensational stories without caring about the lack of its benefits to the public.
we should remember that it is just recently our country received another great international visitation after being visited by president Xi Jinping of China.
government reports expressed that during the visit, several contracts were signed between the two countries (China and Tanzania).
till now the contracts have remained secret.
maybe the situation will be different in this Obama visit from the fact that our Chinese counterparts are still courting secrecy, the matter of citizen's rights to receive and share information is not allowed.
to America, maybe what would be hidden from us is the contract of security secrets, but in real situations we can be informed many agreements between that country and ours following Obama's visit.
but the big problem and the one that makes me to personally view Obama's visit as just an act of being happy about but might not have any importance, it is true that our poverty does not come from lack of donor funding from sponsor nations.
according to recent statistics, for a long time Tanzania has been in the third position worldwide after Afghanistan and Iraq for receiving international aid.
the way of disengaging the Warioba draft
May 15, 2014
for time now those who want good for this country if I borrow the words of English poet WB Yeats, "they spread dream" theirs and laid them down under the footprint of a special constitutional parliament.
they were hoping that that parliament will respect those dreams because they are their dreams themselves the citizens.
but again it came this giant called CCM and stepped on and crushed those dreams.
again with a big arrogance.
as the days move forward it continues to be clear that the party of revolution (CCM) truly turned up to do all it can in order to stop the recommendations of the commission of constitutional review that to be union of three governments.
for this party has no jokes and there are signs that it is ready to use force to fulfill its goal.
but it does not care whether its actions may cause blood to drip.
or messing up of peace of the country.
maybe this is what its enthusiasts want.
it is why one of the honorable people of CCM dared to say that only if the recommendation of three governments is accepted he will enter the forest.
since the constitutional commission released its second draft of constitutional recommendations, the CCM was alert, arranging and disarranging waiting the appropriate time and place to kill and bury that draft.
it decided that the appropriate place is inside the constitutional parliament at the time of its debating.
that parliament met in Dodoma for 67 days and after all those days of discussions, wrangles and accusations nothing important was found.
for sure what came out is to stop the whole process that continued for three years of trying to compose the new constitution of the united republic of Tanzania.
Zanzibaris had great expectations that the government of the united republic and the government of Zanzibar and more those two presidents will lead the process of bringing the new constitution with success.
many expecting that the new constitution will be found before the October 2015 general elections.
after witnessing what happened in Dodoma now there is a big doubt if the new constitution that the citizens want will be found in that period of time.
reason is the stubbornness of CCM for holding that the constitutional parliament must accept manifesto of that party concerning constitutional matters instead of passing the proposed draft by the constitutional commission of the retired judge Joseph Warioba.
the CCM has been using its many members in the committees of the constitutional parliament to force what it wants.
it has done so instead of letting the representatives from Zanzibar and Tanganyika to defend the interests of their countries and they sit together to write a new constitution that will take to the citizens to vote for.
the result of that is that the constitutional parliament was not free like it is supposed to be.
even so there are important issues that were discussed especially concerning the legitimacy of the union which Zanzibar was not authorized formally.
and where the issue of the certificate of the union emerged.
some of the the members of the constitutional parliament held on to want see that certificate signed in April 1964 by the President of the republic of Tanganyika Mwalimu Julius Nyerere together with the President of the people republic of Zanzibar Sheikh Abeid Amani Karume.
that certificate when it was removed after several days passing some of the members of parliament placed doubt on it alleging that it was not valid, it was fabricated and there are those who doubted the signature of Sheikh Karume for it is fake.
for a period of 67 days of constitutional parliament activities we have been hearing unkind language that are not worthy to be heard in a forum like that.
the journalism profession use information to make news.
Mwananchi reader, Severine Leons Mashaka of the Ngerengere region of Morogoro asks: are those who transmit information through phone, private groups on networks - WhatsApp and blog are they journalists?
this is a question that is asked in many parts of the world.
it has raised debate that promotes commentary on information.
read the answers section.
contribute.
it is easy to write anything.
it is not that easy to write a statement.
it is not easy at all to write information.
in each area you need either understanding or knowledge or skill or all at the same time.
in the age of cell phones, whether they are from major industries or alleys that are called "fake", everyone who knows how to join characters and make words that brings meaning, than writes what they want to say.
he sends a greeting or any message.
the phone owner satisfies the need, the right and liberty to communicate with those they want.
he communicates on anything and in any way without any training on how to write.
that is why people today are sending messages of greetings, they send "information" - as they see - on events: accidents, wedding, robbery, victory, construction and whatever they saw or heard.
people share information among themselves.
they write as they would have said.
the message spreads: opinions are given in a common environment of communication between people and different ages - even those that were not aware of it.
when it comes from the greeting section, message and information, you go to the section of "official information."
this might be on government, ministry, company, organization, foundation or any administrative level.
official information maybe provided by the one involved in the mentioned areas that are mentioned above there and many others.
it is information on something, trend, tendency, behavior, changes, plans, preparations, or anything that writers of the information want to inform the wider community.
the information providers in this area are those employed, that are confirmed by their employers that they understand, have knowledge and education for doing that work or experience on the involved equipment or studied.
normally the government informants, organizations, companies, or other foundations - that are called "ladies/gentlemen relationship", have been trained in the field of journalism to serve the area they need.
those are the ones that give the correct information on the offices that have employed them.
it is important here to consider that honor and respect of the government, the company and the organizations is how they want themselves to be seen, even though they are not seen like that in the eyes of someone else.
therefore, the role of an official informer is to also to build or promote what is called "elegance" of the his area of work, good behavior, best and above others.
when we leave the area of "writing anything" and that of giving official information, we shall go to the area of news.
here is where there is a big debate.
it is here that we find journalists.
these have studied this work in various ways including going to school and colleges: to study in the newsroom for official instructors and experience, or by private distance study inside or outside the country.
news journalist call, enter, search office and other areas so that they can get information on anything they target.
they question guards, executives, government chiefs, politicians so that to get information to enable them to get what they want.
what the journalists are looking for, must be emphasized here, it's just information.
by using the knowledge they got in school and colleges, by using the skills expertise they got from newsrooms and directions of their editors, journalists use the information they collected to write news.
information is published, announced and shown in news instruments - newspapers, radio and television.
what is written, has been heard and seen in those instruments is the item that is involved has decided to be called "news".
the discussion climaxes where the question comes: which is and which is not news?
can we get news from phone, blog or WhatsApp from one who is not a news journalist and without passing news instrument?
if news is what you did not know or what is being hidden, and everyday we see new things even in announcements, is media information still right.
the member of parliament demands Duale to stop interfering with the region.
by Kipkorir Rono
the member of parliament for Kuresoi South, Mister Zakayo Cheruiyot has asked the Majority Leader in Parliament Adan Duale to stop involving himself with the politics of that region and instead focus on national issues.
speaking in his constituency, Mister Cheruiyot expressed his anger on Mister Duale's speech when he visited the neighborhood constituency of Kuresoi North.
Mister Duale was quoted saying that he and his group led by deputy president William Ruto would continue to bring development in Kuresoi North constituency represented by Moses Eneo Cheboi (KANU).
in the statement, Mister Duale appeared to separate supporters of Bomet's governor Mister Isaac Rutto and the member of parliament for Kuresoi South as one of them saying they were friends of Raila Odinga and would want to undermine the Jubilee government.
"it's a great shame for leaders to come under the pretext of promoting development in the rural areas while aiming to harass and ridicule others."
said Mister Cheruiyot
Mister Cheruiyot ignored the statement saying already development was seen in his area and did not require Mister Duale and his group to come to him to bring about development.
leaders in Elgeiyo defends Murkomen on conflict with governor
by Everlyne Simiyu
a conflict is continuing to bruise among leaders of Elgeyo Marakwet regarding the retirement of the former Inspector General of Police David Kimaiyo and the appointment of his successor.
a group of youths and experts defended Senator Kipchumba Murkomen (pictured) against some members of parliament that he was involved with "sacking of" Mister Kimaiyo for failing in the job.
"the retiring Inspector of Police decided by himself to retire out of the pressure from Kenyans following the rise of insecurity in the country, and it is inappropriate for some leaders to blame the senator regarding that decision," said the chairperson of Kerio youth association, Aggrey Kiptoo.
several Members of Parliament from Elgeyo/Marakwet County have threatened to ditch themselves from Jubilee coalition and blamed Mister Murkomen for "the sacking" of Mister Kimaiyo.
the members of parliament, Kangogo Bowen (East Markwet), William Kipsang (West Marakwet), Doctor James Murgor (Keiyo North), Doctor Susan Chebet (County female member of parliament), Governor Alex Tolgos and former member of parliament Francis Mutwol have pleaded with President Uhuru Kenyatta to think of filling that gap with someone from that area.
Mister Kimaiyo who retired last month, is from Elgeyo Marakwet county.
but they have claimed that Sanator Murkomen was involved in his removal from office and they want him to explain about the issue fully.

published: 24 September 2016
President John Magufuli has urged provincial and district heads to avoid bringing unnecessary conflicts in their councils, while ordering local governments to cooperate with those leaders to manage development finances.
Daktari Magufuli gave those orders at Musoma town Mara province the day before yesterday, in the speech, which was read on his behalf by the Minister of the Country, Office of the President Provincial Administration and Local Government (TAMISEMI), George Simbachawene when he was opening the 32nd General Meeting of the Local Administration Community (ALAT).

the ban on khat should stand, said Namlef
Isiolo
Islamic leaders from the upper Eastern region have supported the ban of khat in the United Kingdom.
they want the National Authority for the Campaign against Alcohol and Drug Abuse to list the product among narcotic drugs as it has bad effects on human health.
those leaders of the union of NAMLEF led by the chairman of that organization Mister Hussein Guleid said that, the step by Britain was an urge to the government to protect children coming from areas where khat is grown in order to enable them to go to school.
he said the use of the substance has led to family breaking apart especially among pastoral communities.
he said 50 percent of people with mental disabilities in the region is due to chewing khat.

how to teach a child to have good manners.
have you ever given someone something they need but have no reason to say, 'thank you'?
somebody wrongs you and cannot say, 'sorry', 'forgive me'?
there are others even if you do well, saying 'congratulations you have done well' is like punishment and self-denial.
these are some behavior that can show how a person who is not a gentleman and can diminish his value in front of the community.
gentleness is the way one cares about the feelings of others.
to understand what your partner wants, how he feels when you say something, how he feels when you do some things and things like that.
there is a phrase that the behavior of children is the shape of their parents.
the translation of this phrase is that what a person does, largely comes from what he learnt from his parents.
it is saying the gentleness that your child learns depends on how you as a parent puts himself in front of them, in words, in actions and even in behavior.
let us look at four important things that you can put into focus when you teach your child the right way.
giving thanks
giving thanks is to restore the virtue of others.
when you are given a good service at a store, for example, it is fair to be thankful even if you really paid for the service.
a thankful attitude is learned and we are not born with it.
if you want your child to be a person with the ability to recognize the good that others do, it is important to stress the behavior even if it is necessary to set up a compulsory environment.
for example, create a permanent routine that compels each participant at home to say, 'thank you'.
this culture of gratitude is possible if you personally begin to show an example.
thank your spouse in front of your children.
thank your children when they do to you that which you like.
likewise, remind them to be thankful all the time.
commending
when someone else does something good, it is gentle to congratulate him.
commendation makes the person commended to feel comfortable.
teach the child to identify the good things others do and to pronounce the correct words.
become an example by giving commendations.
seek to recognize the efforts expressed by family members and give sincere commendation.
for example, commend your children with the effort they will show in their education.
commend your spouse/wife when they do well in front of the children and not be ashamed.
encourage your children to build up the habit of commending others.
asking for forgiveness and forgiving others
mistakes are part of our shortcomings as human beings.
but not everyone can be ready to apologize even when he knows he is wrong.
they think apologizing is to bringing their status.
if you want your child to have the habit of apologizing and forgiving the wrongdoers you are responsible for teaching him.
show an example yourself by apologizing before your children.
ask your spouse for forgiveness even for small things that you do wrong.
ask your children for forgiveness when you find out you have done wrong.
force them to ask for forgiveness when they find themselves in a mistake.
the fact is, when a child has a tendency to apologize, it is easier to forgive others when he or she is offended.
be concerned about others
appreciating others is knowing that you cannot be better than others.
that does not mean that you are not confidence.
no
basically when you feel confident it's very easy to appreciate others.
you have the responsibility to teach your child how to value other people.
start by showing your children how you value them.
when they get injured, show care and give a gentle opportunity without delay.
when they know that you care about them, they will not have problems about caring for others.
remind them of their responsibility to give a gentle opportunity to the people in problems and the ones in pain.
by doing so you will build good habits of caring for others.

these goats are not able to withstand hot temperatures, but they do well in cold areas like regions of Mbeya, Iringa, Ruvuma, Njombe, Dodoma, Singida and so on they need sufficient food to give more milk, and the food has a full supplement.
although they can also be reared in areas of drought and they could do well (good foragers)
character
these goats live in escaping groups or enter the crop field so they all go and learn it very easily this makes it easy to teach them to be milked by a machine
good apple farming - apples.
an apple is one popular fruit in the world which is normally eaten by people from all communities, this is as a result of its sweetness in addition to health benefits found in eating apples.
these fruits flourish more in highlands where there's no heat, areas such as Lushoto, Arusha, Kilimanjaro slopes, Mbeya, Iringa, Njombe, Songea et cetera.
the soil is very fertile and doesn't leak water.
you can plant using seeds or by buying good seedlings from agricultural institutions such as Uyole Mbeya.
if you'll use seeds, then it's good to buy good seeds or if you fail to get seeds then try to use the ones you'll get from the fruit itself.
if you'll take the ones from the fruit then dry them on the sun first until they're fully dry, the ones that are bought are normally dry so there's no need to dry them, take a soft paper (napkins/tissues) soak it in a small amount of water then take your seeds and tie them using this paper well then put them in a fridge for a period of 3 - 4 weeks they'll start to sprout/growing, putting them in the fridge helps kill disease germs that might have been in the fruit or seed.
take your seed and plant it in the bags or apparatus like a bucket, don't plant in the small bags because this plant normally grows a little big and has deep roots before being planted.
when your plant gets to one to two feet it's a good time to transfer it to the farm.
the distance between one hole to the other is 15 to 18 feet from one tree to the other.
ensure you plant your seedlings during the first rains, the holes should have the height of 2 feet and width of 3 feet.
put 1 tin of manure or nutrients and mix them well with sand.
remember to leave a plate for the sake of tapping rain water or whenever you irrigate and spread an amount 3 feet leaves/grass to surround your tree, ensure animals such as goats and cows don't enter the farm and feed on your trees.
after one year you'll no longer need to irrigate your trees because they'll be able to grow by themselves by depending on rain.
pests and diseases.
the pests that mostly attack apples are moths (moths) and also the black spot disease (black spot) is the one that mostly attacks them, in order to fight diseases and these pests ensure that you use in a destructive manner anything that has pyrethrum (pyrethrum) in it.
harvesting.
harvesting is after three years but back up seedlings starting producing early even within a year, although I advise that you shouldn't allow many fruits on small trees so as to prevent leaves from breaking and hence reducing the fruits before they grow remaining with few.
farmers are requesting sugar industry.
he was employed by John Nditim, Kilombero.
it was published 16 November 2016.
sugar cane farmers of Kilombero, Morogoro has requested the government to enable the starting of other sugar factories in Kilombero Valley so they can produce more.
they have said for now the situation is not good because some of the farmers have left their farms because the factories takes 40 percent only of sugar from the outside farmers
that was said recently while reading their report by the district Kamishna of Kilombero, James Ihunyo, during the graduation of farmers of farm classes of quality agriculture of sugar cane in Kilombero district and Kilosa, Morogoro.
they said due to the current factories having farms, 60 percent of sugar cane that is used to get sugar comes from their farms and therefore the outside farmers have very little part.
while talking on behalf of his fellow graduates, Farmer, kelvin Haule said the introduction of other factories is the solution to the farmers outside of that produce.
even though, he said that training has helped them in improving that agriculture and taking care of the sugar cane in the farm, this situation enabled them to get 47 to 70 tones of sugar cane per hectare different and previously they used to get eight to 16 tones per hectare.
the district Commissioner Ihunyo was the official guest in that graduation, he wanted the farmers of that produce to send themselves and to use better methods of agriculture of production so that they can go together with the speed of the fifth phase of the government so that Tanzania becomes a country of industries and middle economy.
he said those farmers don't have a choice but to recognize the industries that are expected to be built and depend on them to get raw materials out of the agricultural sector in order to produce various types of goods.
he said so that we reach those goals it is good for farmers to join groups and register them so that they get loans from bank institutions so that they can get various fertilizers different from now where they rely on manifestation of God
moreover, he also congratulated the researchers of the center of research on sugar cane, Kibaha, Coast province for training the farmers of that produce, a step that enabled them to improve on production of sugar cane.
the researcher from the Center of research on sugar cane, Kibaha, the unit of supplying technology, Diana Nyanda, she said that the farms and class started in the years 2010 being with five groups and 77 farmers, but every year they have been adding farms class and farmers and until year 2016 there are 33 groups and 584 farmers.
so she said, together with the training, they have been brought for also quality seeds for sugar cane that perseveres drought and diseases, including NCO 376.

put on your steel helmet we go to the streets and demand for education instead of language June 20, 2012
to the minister of tension and vex, Uzitoni Street, Bongo.
dear Frank, how are you my love?
how are you doing there?
there are no upheavals?
or you are already called freemason?
please tell me, because I nowadays see that as the modern trend, if not political insults.
anyone with little effort, freemason.
people of a particular party, freemason.
that is to say, there is something I want to know because these confusions of something without a head or legs are annoying me.
so who suddenly came up with the freemason topic and why and for whose benefit?
why have we lived for all these years without hearing about freemasons?
suddenly everything, freemason, freemason.
when I asked Binti Bosi she really laughed.
then she told me that the freemasons started as an association of technicians so that through their unity, be able to defend their interests against masters who had the habit of exploiting them.
masters are just masters.
from one generation to another.
that is why I feel that even here, it's our masters who have stirred up all these controversies so as to cover up the fact that they are exploiting workers.
and to make people have doubt between themselves instead of uniting.
but dear first, I have to admit my arrogance.
since BB appeared to know the concerns of the founding technicians, I had to ask her with my silly mischief.
"but you sister, are you also a freemason?"
let her laugh my love.
"you Hidaya, you don't have the intellect or what?"
I don't know freemasons, neither do I have a reason to know them more than what I have read when they started that chaos.
first, it's not free.
they that hold freemason's signs have their own reasons, and it's especially a strategy to hide their things.
"brokers?"
"ha ha ha and you Hidaya?
it is truly possible that they are dealers since they are the ones who don't want us to look at them and they perceive us and make us feel selfish instead of focusing on the reality."
"like the old man with cup bearing everything."
"alright.
and as we are, taking in everything given to us like a toilet."
"but the newspapers have also contributed."
whose newspapers?
aren't they these ones?
together with selling their newspapers, they are just one team."
then we really laughed but it's very annoying.
my younger sister recently wrote to me that there is an organization that came with a plan to assist girls who had been impregnated and left desolated.
now they wanted to join the others who have excitement and without any skills and tried to discourage them by calling them freemasons.
actually, even when a person struggles to rescue himself, people's mouth are itchy as if they have eaten nettle (and also talk recklessly).
luckily, my sister cannot listen to that nonsense but others were afraid.
I mean, us Bongolians don't jump into things at all.
and I see we youths are the worst.
the first to hear rumors and spread it.
instead, we should look at the reality.
recently, I for real was watching the celebrations of the day of the African child.
I was compelled to laugh in pain.
that we have been respected as leaders in celebrating Africanism.
therefore, I expected to see the children full in a large amount.
I expected that those giving opinions and facilitating the debate to be the children.
where... or maybe we say that the elderly have entered the second childhood.
all the speeches of adult people.
their audience in a language that the children who are the majority cannot comprehend, they are adults if not mad people.
only a few children were seen as though stacked there with superglue to justify that it's their day.
this for sure, lie to a child among the children.
what was their work there?
okay, at least other organizations involved children such as center for human rights.
again I was very impressed with children there because they really talked.
is not about commemorating hypocritically that the children do not still have the required opportunity.
those children condemned as to why there is a great disparity between their schools and those of the affluent.
how will a child in a class with one hundred and fifty pupils compete with a child in a class of thirty pupils?
the education of cheat the child again
is similar to two children to fight with fists while the arm of one is tied.
it's not logical at all.
our bosses who talk about children's rights, don't they see those differences?
okay, and when I'm upset about it, the activists reminded us that the objective of the day is not the bosses' speeches but the operations of the Soweto youth against being taught in a language they don't want, and they don't understand, that is imperialism.
that's when I got the idea my dear.
what is the difference between our schools and those in Soweto?
we the majority are being taught in a language that we completely do not understand.
and as they expand these poverty schools, then the numbers continue to increase of those sentenced to a four-year jail term without understanding.
then I later tried my idea on BB.
she halfheartedly accepted because she is enrolled in those schools with few pupils and many teachers.
but she was eventually compelled in her heart to accept.
"you know Hidaya, they have done a lot of research that shows that many students, cannot answer well, questions of grade two when they are in grade ten."
for sure it's of no significance.
'better people be taught in a language they understand.'
'it's true sister.'
'my objective is to get various skills and not to pour out the English language in front of the whites or their followers.'
allow BB to laugh.
"you Hidaya, is a trouble maker?"
"no sister, it annoys me how thousands of students are disillusioned not because they are dumb but because they don't have a language.
and how could they get the language when they have grown up in an environment without television?
'I have brothers who were very bright in primary school but the English language in secondary finished them.'
"so what do you want to do?"
"what did the Soweto students do?"
they demonstrated in protest.
and they continued demonstrating despite being shot and arrested and imprisoned without a mistake.
and their efforts bore fruit because even the struggles to fight for independence became stronger.
'do you see sister?'
why don't the students here start demonstrating as well?"
"the problem is that here in South Africa, they were being forced to speak the colonizers' language that is not spoken anywhere outside their country.
but English is an international language..."
"ah, where sister?
yes, it is an international language to few people.
and it can be taught as a subject.
but we the majority want just to understand the concepts."
"I have not denied.
but people really have a stereotype about the language to the extend that if you propose to do away with it, they will demonstrate in protest ha ha ha."
'maybe sister.'
but I think it is important to make them understand.
for sure it annoys me.
it also offended me and look here.
why am I working without anxiety?
the pan does not speak English.
nor the broom.
BB laughs again.
"then let's try.
we see how many will resist coming out of the classroom.
the problem is they do not want to appear naive hence the reason they will just remain silent."
"and they will call me freemason."
"that's it!"
we all laughed.
but how do you see it dear?
you cannot convince your colleagues to stand and begin protesting against the language used for teaching that disadvantages us, the majority?
this language is another way of favoring children of the rich leaving us hopeless with our helplessness.
put on your steel helmet we go to the streets and demand for education rather than language.
the one that loves you in all languages, Hidaya.
the CCM with its fools on its back!
May 30, 2012
from the small town of Mbalizi in Mbeya Province, we have heard the Vice-Chairman of the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (retired), John Malecela.
he has told citizens of rural Mbeya Province that, CCM would not put up with stupid (corrupt people) on their backs.
this is not a new statement to Tanzanians ears.
some senior leaders in CCM have been heard repeatedly insisting that their party should not be linked to the corruption by some of their members.
but new to Malecela is the weight of the words he used to convey the message.
he has called them "those corrupt fools."
surely this is not a statement to pass without being discussed.
Malecela had been addressing a rally to campaign for the CCM candidate for Mbeya Rural, January 13, this year.
as had mentioned earlier, this is not a new statement to Tanzanians ears.
leaders like Yusuf Makamba and others including Retired President Ali Hassan Mwinyi, have ever talked about it.
in their remarks they have been insisting that those accused of graft should not to be linked with their party.
they should be prosecuted and condemned as individuals.
but the funny thing is that, while the CCM leaders sweat on the podiums exhorting the citizens to prosecute corrupt persons individually without involving the party, the corrupt persons still hold CCM cards.
yes!
they still posses CCM cards, they wear the party's uniform and worse they participate in the planning sessions for the future of the party.
but they also sponsor the party's internal elections and even help to finance campaigns for some of the candidates vying for internal leadership.
yes!
despite that they are suspects accused by the CCM government for theft of public funds, they still continue to contribute funds for the development of the ruling party.
the party of the government that has charged them.
this is yet another proof that the hearts of our leaders have embraced theories more and done away with actions.
as I had stated earlier, old man Malecela has used harsh words which are somewhat similar to the anger of the citizens against corruption and corrupt people.
Mzee Malecela has been quoted by the Uhuru newspaper of January 15 this year, saying,
"they think the CCM will carry them on its back in order for them to be content.
CCM will never put up with those people."
Mzee Malecela found himself issuing that statement after sensing that politicians from the opposition parties are emerging to disrepute his party by insisting that it is not taking any appropriate action on the corrupt people.
and in his sensing he said, "there are people who will come here and say stupid things, that ooh corrupt people."
personally I am motivated by the words, "they think the CCM will bear the stupid (corrupt people) on its back, it cannot bear those people."
as I had mentioned earlier, Mzee Malecela absolutely denies that CCM is ready to put up with corrupt people.
however, on my part I am not sure whether those corrupt people have returned or been stripped off of their party membership cards of that party.
yes, you could say they have not yet been proven in court that they are corrupt therefore they cannot be stripped off their cards.
if that's the argument, let's ask ourselves whether CCM is a party with leaders who believe in the concept of "best practice"?
so, is this a party that is supposed to be a party leading in the concept of "best practice" to ultimately build a solid foundation for good governance in the country?
the fact is that each corruption suspect with a CCM's card is still a member of CCM and furthermore the actions by a member of this party to the point of being taken to court is proof that he has violated his party's beliefs that were formerly called TANU members beliefs.
but despite all this, I should emphasize that this strong statement by Mzee Malecela is not to be ridiculed.
it is probably a statement to be supported.
but support for affirmative action and not acts of "covering up for the bastards."
personally, I have lent weight to that statement by asking myself if it is true that CCM is really not bearing fools on its back?
but when I ask myself, the list of representatives of the Central Committee (CC) of the Executive Committee (NEC) of CCM began to organize its thoughts.
it is a relatively long list, composed of at least 38 people.
these include national leaders, retired veterans and those who continue to lead the nation.
there are also retired presidents.
there are also about four ministers of Kikwete's government and two deputy ministers.
but also including ministers of the fourth government who had resigned due to pressure.
they include Andrew Chenge and Edward Lowassa.
this committee is led by President Jakaya Kikwete as Chairman, Pius Msekwa Vice-Chairman, Mainland Tanzania and President Amani Abeid Amani Karume, Vice-Chairman for Zanzibar.
ministers in this committee include George Mkuchika, John Chiligati, Bernard Membe and Muhammed Seif Khatib, while the ranks of Deputy Ministers are composed of Omar Yusuf Mzee, Emmanuel Nchimbi and Doctor Maua Daftari.
the other representatives are Yussuf Makamba (Secretary General), Salehe Ramadhan Ferouz (Deputy Secretary General - Zanzibar) Vice President, Doctor Ali Mohamed Shein, Shamsi Vuai Captain, Retired Presidents Ali Hassan Mwinyi and Benjamin Mkapa.
other representatives are: Rashid Mfaume Kawawa, Doctor Salmin Amour, John Malecela, Amos Makala, Kidawa Hamid Saleh and Samuel Sitta.
also included are Pandu Ameir Kificho, Anna Abdallah, Rostam Aziz, Doctor Mohamed Gharib Bilal and Pindi Chana.
others are Samia Suluhu Hassan, Haji Omar Kheri, Doctor Abdallah Omari Kigoda, Abdurahman Kinana, Anne Makinda, Fatuma Said Ali Mchumo, Zakia Meghji, now in order to satisfy oneself that this party is leading in "best practice" let's consider the orderliness of some (not all) in the Central Committee.
and furthermore, every representative should question his conscience and measure his dignity in the world of those who are corrupt and those who are not corrupt.
compare Mzee Malecela's statement to some representatives of the Executive Committee, while we remember that that is the top organ in planning CCM's future.
a future that also involves the party in eliminating graft as well as graft involving senior officials in and out of government.
let's ask ourselves whether the layer that constitutes CCM's Executive Committee has the complete 'holiness' that is required?
is the Executive Committee composed of all pure people and who have the courage of condemning corruption without mincing words?
these are the questions that we can ask the representatives of the Executive Committee, one after the other.
do they all believe that the CCM will not bear fools on its back?
and if it cannot, is it true those fools (corrupt people) being talked about by Mzee Malecela are completely not involved in the Executive Committee?
and if they are, why has it become impossible to make them accountable in the context of 'best practice'?
and let's ask ourselves, who are those who should not be borne on CCM's back?
and at the same time ask ourselves, there in the Executive Committee what role does hypocrisy play in the discussions in dealing with corrupt people?
but we later ask Mzee Malecela, among the fools he is talking about, are some among them still leaders in the party and or government?
God bless Tanzania, God bless Africa.
Zanzibar dismissed May 30, 2012
why do we interpret words?
suppose the fact is that if the Union is to crush to be blamed is not Zanzibar but Revolutionary Party (CCM) that has failed to demonstrate the ability to defend the Union for deliberate movements and strategies and instead to promote the belief in disagreeing by opposing to the Union through guns, threats and force.
it's a time of separation in Tanzania as the country has so much to worry about it to raise its people from the curse of eternal poverty.
we have many things to do to lead our people towards economic independence and development that gives everyone a chance to succeed.
it is impossible in this period of time to begin frustration and advocacy of the Union.
issue of the Union was to be completed 20 years ago.
because of weaknesses and bad leadership of CCM today we have reached the precipice of separation.
CCM has shown us that they cannot defend the Union. no CCM leader is able to stand still to defend the Union.
not their elders and not their young people, not their scholars and not their activists, not of the continent and not of the island.
there is no Union defender.
not Salim, not Bilal, not Makamba and certainly not Kikwete.
we do not look at Mkapa nor Sumaye to defend the Union.
CCM has lost confidence in defending the Union, so why not tell the truth?
this is a time of separation in order to have two free and indigenous nations like international states that relate to the world through international agreements and international issues.
failure to solve long-term issues has brought us here we must say the facts and facts to be known.
what is happening now should not have happened if our leaders would have demonstrated the ability to overcome the problems of the Union.
my brothers inability to solve these has turned these problems into 'Union's resistant disorders'.
that is, it is a difficult disagreement.
because they have been unable to solve for 50 years time has come now to accept defeat and give up to leave the Union.
these resistant problems have shown and revealed the bottom line of the potential limitations of our leaders.
neither Elder Mwinyi nor Mkapa had the capability to establish solutions to the challenges of the Union.
Kikwete, who entered with huge promises has confirmed that he (with all his rule) has no power to solve these problems.
who has forgotten the words of President Kikwete's heartfelt appeal to the Union parliament after he was sworn in as President and launched the parliament in December 2005?
he is the one who said these words "we have a historic role to ensure that our Union remains and grows stronger.
I am happy to say that our Union is strong despite challenges here and there.
and, more encouraging to me is the fact that our both sides of the Union are committed to resolving existing problems with a view to strengthening it."
six years after these words our union is weak and 'the challenges here and there' have been a permanent problem!
Kikwete also failed!
spreading hatred against Christians and Tanganyika it should be understood that those fighting the Union are essentially having a problem with Christians and people of the mainland and especially those who come from the mainland that is Tanganyika.
some of the leaders of these lectures give statements that the ordinary person considers as a permit and call for evil to the people of Tanganyika.
because, if they are mixed up, they are persecuting Zanzibar and Tanganyika people of Zanzibar, is it not right for Zanzibar to abuse their opponents?
because, if Tanganyika is actually treating Zanzibar as his colony is not justified for the ones being forcefully governed by Tanganyika to rise against the people of Tanganyika?
and more surprisingly (and annoying) their government also becomes silent on these actions.
have churches started this week being burnt in Zanzibar?
have bars started being burnt in Zanzibar the other day or is it that people have a sudden forgetfulness?
the statement issued the other day to assure "tourists" that the situation was calm did not mention the people of the Mainland who on Monday had leaflets asking them to leave Zanzibar.
this is not the first time for such leaflets to appear in Zanzibar and proves the failure of our country's intelligence system!
but what have Christians in Zanzibar done wrong?
is it really true that they want Christians to be only those born in Zanzibar and others who come and move there is wrong?
as Sheikh Fared said in March, if someone did not announce any hostility or raise up arms against you how would you announce them enemy?
all long as the churches are burned in Zanzibar, there has never been any mad person not even one thought of burning a mosque, when such a person appears is that not when war against Christians will be announced?
you will also find it unnecessary even for a Christian to do so because another guy decides to disturb the Muslims by burning the mosque (knowing they will accuse Christians or the Heretics) are not these theologians proclaiming a permanent war?
now, this should be said to these leaders - if they do not want Christians in Zanzibar they should openly say so, so that they can leave Zanzibar in peace!
if they want Zanzibar that does not have a Christian identity because many Muslims say so instead of burning people their churches and threatening the lives of people.
I say this believing that the actions of the churches being burnt and people of Tanganyika threatened have been tolerated and are not adequately criticized.
we have not heard famous people from Zanzibar like Doctor Salim, Elder Mwinyi, Doctor Bilal and others giving statements to protect these Christians and Tanganyikans.
they are silent.
what does it mean?
we have not seen any one of them visit these houses of worship of Christian that were burned up in January this year?
what are they afraid of?
destroy the Union completely for people reading my articles to realize that my current position is not new.
April 27, 2011, I am writing articles in this newspaper, edition 183, entitled "our Union has no defenders be ready to break down".
however, that was the conclusion of the argument I had built one year back.
I wrote in the 147 edition August 2010 title of the article "they are breaking the Nation with the aim of 'strengthening the Union'".
all articles were simply indicating that our Union has come to a place of agreeing to break it in order to cooperate as two countries.
Zanzibaris who from the beginning their goal was that "we have already allowed so many of them in the country."
since the beginning, they have been left to Zanzibar without being forced to totally disappear but want more.
now the CCM Government has given them all, a flag, national anthem, its president, its cabinet, its parliament, various forces now that they want their country to can we keep them?
how can we keep them?
so somebody everyday claims to be given a table, demanding seats and coats, demanding cabinets and internal decors, he is coming and claiming the housing wall and all of it is given today he decides to claim the house are we shocked?
did we think of those tables and cabinets that they had put under a mango tree?
already CCM has agreed to give Zanzibar all the needs of a country, now the time has come for Zanzibar to be a country, get out of the union.
as I said last year that our Union has no defenders then I have chosen to be a defender of breaking the Union.
break it down so that we can be safe.
I still believe in the African Union as the basic principle that brought forth Tanzania and I still believe it is in unity only that our countries will be able to succeed but this unity as the Zanzibar we do not want.
the time has come to the people of the mainland to begin to emerge and make conferences and demonstrations to deny the Union.
not because Zanzibar is against us or they can do anything against Tanganyika - they cannot - but because we do not want like the people of the Mainland to walk in blame of being against Zanzibar!
we do not want to live and feel like colonials when there is nothing that Zanzibar do or do not do that hurt us or even add us anything.
mainland Tanzania does not depend on Zanzibar for anything but Zanzibar relies on it and will continue to rely on Tanzania Mainland!
now if this is true - and it is true - let Zanzibar be left alone.
any history student knows exactly what will happen to Zanzibar again.
since the CCM and its Government have failed to defend the Union and solve the problems of the Union, the time has come to let Zanzibar go.
let Zanzibar go and return to their homeland to end peacefully.
we love Zanzibar so much that we cannot struggle with them!
they want to go let them go.
until a generation comes to judge politicians and religious leaders who love collisions more than unity, hatred than love, violence rather than peace.
these who want to break the nation there is a generation that will judge them severely.
for us we say let Zanzibar go!
how the constitution was found
October 11, 2014
leaders threaten to leave posts, frequent meetings of the ministers of Zanzibar union and rise in emotions among members of constitutional parliament are among the issues that came up during the process of looking for the proposed constitution that ends today.
according to the news that was found after interviews with the members of the special constitutional parliament (BMK), official news of the parliament from the meetings of those committees and the revolution of the parliament itself, Raia Mwema has got a picture of what particularly was going on behind the scenes.
among the news that this newspaper has got is the step of former chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee, Andrew Chenge threatening to quit his position if representatives of the committee could have forced things that would degrade the dignity of the committee.
according the official news of the committee, Chenge directed after some of the representatives of his committee wanting the current system of having the president and a running-mate to be changed and instead the president to have two deputies who are the president of Zanzibar and the prime minister of Tanzania.
Chenge had suggested that the president of the republic of the union is supposed to have a deputy who is a running-mate from his party, while having two other deputies who are Zanzibar's president and the prime minister of Tanzania.
"if you want to eliminate the position of co-aspirant and then we have Zanzibar's president and the prime minister then you look for another person to present their ideas.
then we shall be doing a job that people will be shocked by us.
"later in the journey, it might come up that the president of Zanzibar comes from a different party from Tanzania's president.
if now there is no running-mate and the president meets trouble, it means that whoever succeeds will come from a different party.
"according to the current constitution and the one proposed, the prime minister is supposed to come from the party with majority members in parliament.
if it happens that the prime minister comes from a different party with his president, meaning the president has more votes than his members of parliament, will you not find the president from another party there?" questioned Chenge.
the written reports confirmed by some of representatives who were in the committee who, however, state that wisdom was applied and finally Chenge's suggestions are the ones that have been adopted into the proposed constitution.
the constitution suggests to have three deputy presidents who are the running-mate who becomes the first deputy, the president of Zanzibar who will be the second deputy while the prime minister becomes the third.
news from the committee states that however, Chenge was a leader without emotions in his committee and that maybe the work could have been difficult if the chairperson was Doctor Asha Rose Migiro who was stated to have a tough stand.
Raia Mwema has been told that while BMK proceeds, there happened at least two meetings of the ministers of the union and those from Zanzibar, in discussing financial matters in the new constitution.
it is the meeting and the tough debates, this newspaper has been told, that finally caused the calling of the Governor of the central bank Professor Benno Ndullu to Dodoma, together with his assistants in order to explain financial and union matters.
"you know people think that when the members of parliament from CCM remained in the parliament and those without a wing unity of the people's constitution (Ukawa), then BMK cooled down.
I assure you, the parliament was very active now.
"there is time emotions were rising till you decide to have a break or call experts from outside so that you get detailed explanations.
those who were outside, have missed a lot," said one of the representatives of BMK who even though did not like his name mentioned.
the proposed constitution is expected to be presented to presidents Jakaya Kikwete and Doctor Ali Mohamed Shein in the scene that was planned to happen in Jamuhuri stadium in Dodoma from two pm today.

Chadema faces upheavals
Doctor Slaa's card ownership scandal erupts another one secretary Bavicha claims he is ready to be dismissed
the political state inside the party of democracy and development (Chadema), in Tanga province has continued to get complex after the secretary for youth committee for the party Mister Deogratius Kisandu claimed the chairman of the party in the province Mister Saidi Mbweto is used by CCM leaders to sabotage the party.
that step results from a big conflict that came up in that party in that province after Mister Mbweto accusing Mister Kisandu for his opinion of wanting the results of 2010 general elections to be annulled since CCM presented two candidates for the presidency position.
Mister Kisandu's claims to want those results nullified comes after the Chadema secretary general Doctor Willibrod Slaa admitted possessing a CCM card therefore while vying for presidency in the year 2010, he was still a member of the ruling party.
he said as a result of that condition it is clear that CCM presented two presidential candidates who are Doctor Slaa and President Jakaya Kikwete who emerged the winner in the elections.
speaking with Majira yesterday, Mister Kisandu said he is ready to be dismissed from Chadema if he will perceived undisciplined for standing for the truth.
he said the act of announcing his intentions to vie for presidency in the year 2015 has been a thorn for politicians of that party as well as using some of the groups in order to weaken him politically.
"I don't live for pleading for a post, my intention to vie for presidency I know hurts Mister Mbweto, that is why he is being used to spoil my name for it is the plan of God for me to be the president of Tanzania. the means he is using against me shall not succeed and those who say I am a betrayer are the great betrayers," he said.
he said the party is in a big conflict and made known that if actions will not be taken, it will fall apart as it happened to CUF and NCCR-revolutionary parties which got a lot of power after joining multi-party systems.
"even the chairman of Bavicha nation, Mister John Heche too called me and blamed me for my opinion which I basically wanted the national electoral commission (NEC), to change presidency results for 2010 elections.
"CCM presented two candidates according to Mister Nape Nnauye's speech (the NEC secretary for Ethics and Propagation-CCM), I believe if the presidential election is repeated we Chadema shall win," he said.
the other day while Mister Mbweto was speaking to the press, he put clear the stand of taking suggestions of taking serious actions against Mister Kisandu for giving opinions of wanting Doctor Slaa to resign for possessing a CCM card.
that very time, writer Wilhelm Mulinda reports from Mwanza that, a day after the former candidate for member of parliament on Chadema ticket for Sumvo constituency in that province, in the 2010 general elections Mister Milton Lutabana joined CCM, yesterday he gave 2400 shillings in order to pay for Doctor Slaa his two years membership fee until 2015 for continuing to hold the ruling party's card.
Mister Lutabana handed the money to the deputy CCM secretary general, Mister Mwigulu Nchemba so that he hands it to Mister Nnauye and to present it to the district party branch in Karatu district, Arusha province, where Doctor Slaa joined as a member.
the fee was given during a special council meeting for CCM, Ilemela district, in that province where Mister Mwigulu was the official guest.
Mister Lutabana becomes the first CCM member to pay Doctor Slaa a fee ever since, when Mister Nnauye said that the Chadema secretary possesses the ruling party card and he himself admitting possessing that card where in that meeting, 85 Chadema members differed to CCM.

the stakeholders who are Education officials, Ward Education Coordinators and experts involved in implementing Education Development have said that the 'equip Tanzania' Program has greatly contributed to increasing the level of education in the curriculum due to the reduction of existing challenges, including poor parent and teacher cooperation.
they were talking during a specialized training provided by 'equip' in Kahama district in Shinyanga Ward for building capacity to communicate and exchange information on implementation results.
the stakeholders have commended the program by establishing a partnership with parents and teachers popularly known as the UWW.

published: 16 December 2016.
the Channel for farmer's groups in Tanzania (MVIWATA) has requested the government to allow farmers in the country to sell their produce outside the country to enable them sell at a price that will give them profit to uplift them from poverty.
while addressing the 21 meeting of MVIWATA, the chairman of that institution Veronica Sophu said the is an order which was given out by the head of the district and the region banning selling of farm produce outside the country this is not beneficial to a farmer who spends more and when he harvest he will be forced to sale his produce.
"as farmers we have used our resources, our efforts on harvesting you force us to sell our produce in the country at a low price while we farmers need a lot of money to educate our children, stopping us from selling outside the country our produce we think its not right..." said Sophu.
he added that the farmers have their needs that require huge money so stopping them from sealing their product outside the country is the same as giving them a ticket to continue having hardship life and continuing to swim in abject poverty.
he requested the government to end the fake input that is distributing that has caused lower productivity.
"how does this compost goes beneath?" the leader asked.
where is the mechanism to regulate the quality?
he said the farmers in Tanzania spend more money to buy fertilizers and when they use this input it does not give good result and this hinders development because of using fake fertilizer.
the chairman requested the government to end the rift between the farmers and breeders by making sure there is good use of the land.
he said the political leaders own large tracks of land in Morogoro region land and it is good the government to take that land and give it to the citizens so that they can use it with farming and keeping their animals.
also the guardian of Mviwata- Taifa Stephen Mashishanga said that given the importance of farmers since they are ones who feed the country, therefore the government should give priority to address the problem of the farmers with immediate effect.
Mashishanga also said the government must give a solution to land conflict because it destroys the peace of the country.
"the government must check where made mistake so that we can correct."
Regina Chonjo head of Morogoro district said that the government recognize that agriculture is the main thing that can substitute the economy of industries and the government is ready to tackle the problems and challenges that faces agriculture and also solve land dispute.
he also wanted parent to give part of their land to the children so that they can own something and they gain financially.
he also want the the farmers to stop shifting cultivation because it leads to destruction of the environment.

women steal from their husbands in the pockets.
Dar es Salaam.
some women or men can steal money from each other inside the house.
whether it is in the wallet or pockets of pants for men, or a woman's purse.
it is explained women are the supervisors in the exercise of doing frightening tours in the pockets of their husbands.
seven out of 10 women that were interviewed by this newspaper, have admitted to once stealing from their husbands or lovers, while only two men out 10 have admitted having once done that.
in every matter, there is a reason.
some of the women who got time to talk, explained reasons for doing that, including not being given enough money, to mix them in order to solve some family matters and to reduce the weight of money from the pouches of their drinking husbands.
Abdallah Kilemi, says even if the money they take, they use because of family needs, they aren't supposed to do that because that is theft.
he says normally, a woman is supposed to tell her husband if she took money from the pocket instead of doing that in secret.
"some of them take for their own benefit instead of the benefit of the family, my wife used to do that time and again and I knew, except I never asked her".
"I investigated after seeing every day when I woke up in the morning I have less money from what I came back with yesterday and after one or two days, she changes or she has made another hairstyle, bought clothes or new shoes," complains Kilemi.
Patrick Innocent says, he has prohibited his wife from taking his money, even if she finds it when she's washing because she has been using it as a pretext to buy things with a lot of money.
"she buys a lot of cosmetics and takes a package to her home if you ask her to know where she has gotten the money, she says she usually takes money from my pouch when I come back drunk or when she is collecting clothes in order to clean them".
"I don't believe if they are enough to do all the things she does, I don't want to hear she bought something with that money, it can't be that amount," says Innocent.
a resident of Tandika Dar es Salaam city, Zubeda Yasini says her husband has been using a lot of money on things that aren't fundamental, including drinking liquor with friends and getting totally drunk, therefore when he comes back she reduces him the high quantity of money.
she says, she once kept the money she picks from her husband's pockets until she got fees to pay for their daughter, who was learning at a nursery school and that it was hard for her husband to give money to pay for the child and whenever she told him, he said he didn't have.
"she explains whenever he gives her money for food end of the month, they will have finished with each other even if an emergency will occur, there is nothing he gives her and the answer is, I don't have."
"alcohol he drinks every day, but money to satisfy home needs, he doesn't add if he gives at the end of the month even if it will be enough to buy a packet of flour that's it, if there is an emergency, I add from my business of rice buns that is swaying from side to side," says Zubeda.
Jacqueline Martini, a resident of Tandale, Dar es Salaam city, says, whenever she receives a salary, she shows her husband and agrees with him on what to do, but for a period of eight months, her husband doesn't contribute anything in their agreements.
she says even she got a salary increase, she didn't tell him because she's squeezing him and has invented a new way of stealing from the pouch whenever he forgets himself.
"I am lucky, various times, I have been lucky to steal from him up to 150,000, 500,000 shillings and he is unable to ask me because he doesn't involve me in his finance issues more than to take mine," says Jacqueline.
she says there is a day she once asked him for 1,000 shillings he said he didn't have, but when he went to the bathroom, she searched his pockets and emerged with two notes of 10,000 shillings she didn't do any lingering, she took them and he has not asked her to date and life continued.
an expert on psychological issues from the University of Dodoma, Modester Kamongi says that every day a woman believes she is the manager of important house issues while depending on her husband for money even if she works.
therefore, if the husband doesn't give her, she gets a hard time and asks herself where are they going and even thinks, he's taking to other women when she searches him and gets even a little she gets relieved.
"I don't support that behavior except psychologically it gives women benefit if they believe, they are using the same as their husbands even if if they haven't been given, especially for those who are denied," he says.
Krish Buruhan (not a real name), a student who is in a relationship says, the work she does for her lover including satisfying him sexually isn't comparable to the money he gives her, therefore if she gets a chance, she steals small small.
she says whenever she meets him, she seeks an opportunity on how to steal from him and because her lover believes in her as a result of her young age, he has never felt her.
"he has his wife, he has no plans of marrying me, he's using me and the money he gives me is little, aah".
"I squeeze myself with him on the pouch, I never left him whenever I get a chance, when I am with him, I don't think of anything more than 'to beat him' so that at least, I pay myself," says Krish.

speaking to this newspaper at her home here in the city, she said that the school her grandchild attends is expected to close at the end of December this year and that she has been the one taking him to and from school.
she said that since June this year, an arrangement was set for parents or guardians to bring and take their children while in the previous years they were transported by their teachers bringing and taking them once school was closed.
'I have begun an early request for people who are able to help since we do not have the ability and we have been asking for contributions from various people for the fare to take him," said Mwajuma.
she said the situation is very difficult as there are times they find themselves having only one meal due to the real situation as it is, whereby they have had a life of chance as a result of not having any special activity.
"we depend on the burning and selling of charcoal together with weaving mats which help us in getting income and cash for food for my family," said Mwajuma.
in addition, Laila Nassoro, the child's mother, who also is blind said that when the time comes for bringing or taking him to their school it's a great challenge because they depend on begging people to contribute to get the funds.
she said her son is doing well educationally because last year he led the class by being number one and in the sixth month this year he held the second position, something that gives them comfort that he could become the savior of the family.
Meru's are against women inheriting land.
written by Veronica Mheta, Arusha.
printed: 14 December 2016.
leaders of the Ameru tribe, Washili Arusha region have asked the government to change the land law of the year 1999, claiming that it disagrees with the tradition and customs of their tribe since it is the source of many disputes in that region.
but instead, those leaders want the law that gives women inheritance of land to go with the traditions and customs of their tribe that denies women the right to inherit and selling land in that region.
they claimed that the land laws of the year 1999 that gives a woman the right to inherit, own, to utilize it and also selling it when she wants, is a source of many land conflicts in that district because most of the widows have been selling family land without permission.
according to those clan leaders, women and girl child in that tribe have a right to use and own the inherited land but they are not allowed exchange the land ownership without engaging the the traditional elders of that clan.
while speaking in a campaign of increasing understanding of women in the ownership of land and property to women of Arumeru district which was started by the party of women lawyers in Tanzania (Tawla) in Maji ya Chai ward, the leader of traditional clan of Pallangyo, Jackson Emanuel Pallangyo claimed that never will Meru allow a woman to have final decisions in the ownership of land and property for inheritance.
"they are allowed to own and use the land and property but they have no right to have the final decision of those properties because according to their traditions, it is a must they involve the clans' old men before doing anything and that is our stand which can never be changed," he insisted during the launch of that campaign.
when he was asked if those traditional leaders can agree with the commitment of the government to involve women and men equally in levels of leadership and provision of decision, Pallangyo claimed that to them can never be possible because women are easily lied to than women.
that stand was supported with another old tradition man, Zakayo Loti Nnko of Kitefu village in Maji ya Chai ward who claimed that giving women their final rights of ownership of land and property it is to give them stubbornness, to show contempt to their husbands when they get married and having an opportunity to share those properties when the husband dies.
however, those stands were resisted by some of the women who attended that launch and they claimed that those traditions and customs have been used to withhold women's right of land ownership and property and they are the ones that are contributing to a lot of women being harassed in that district.
she too Bertha Ayo, the resident of Kitefu village in that ward of Maji Ya Chai said that a lot of land conflicts in that district arise when a husband dies whereby the brothers of the deceased want to rob the widow with on the pretext of traditions but the main thing is greed for property because of the land having a high value in those areas.
previously, the Tawla project coordinator, Cesilia Ngaiza said the three years campaign, will involve the community itself to have debates in the village and the ward level and to arouse the problems that are there in the issues of ownership of land and property for women and the best way to deal with them.
let us continue to support the government on the Kagera earthquake
written by the Editor
published: 19 September 2016
two major events took place in Dar es Salaam City during the weekend concerning earthquakes in Kagera.
the first event was of the Second Term Retired President, Ali Hassan Mwinyi, leading a walk to assist victims of the earthquake, where a total of 502 million shilling was raised.
the five kilometer walk was organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the East Africa cooperation.
the second event was of President John Magufuli receiving the disaster report caused by the quake in Kagera Province and the neighboring provinces of Mwanza, Geita and Kigoma, from Prime Minister Kassim Fate.
we support the Prime Minister's statement, where he said that the government has taken various measures for the quake victims, which include sending food, medical services and contingency reserves, and has also collected contributions from different parts and that up till now 3.3 billion shillings have been raised.
likewise, we support President Magufuli's conclusion to request Tanzanians to ignore the people who want to use the disaster to spread dissension and hatred against the government.
we emphasize, as the President said, that there is currently no technology to predict the occurrence of the earthquake and the quake was never brought about by the government.
thus, there is no reason for any person, group of people or any institution to use the quake for spreading falsehoods with the aim of creating conflict between the government and the citizens.
an earthquake is a disaster like any other disasters, such as fire, hurricanes, floods and so on.
even wealthy nations with significant economic, technological and industrial developments are prone to earthquakes which cause many deaths and major property damage.
in fact, China experienced an earthquake in the year 2014, where 617 people lost their lives, 193 people died in 2013 and 2,998 died in 2010.
with regard to Japan, an earthquake killed 15,904 people in the year 2011 and 12 people in 2008.
we request the state apparatus to monitor all those who began spreading rumors and also monitor those who want to use the disaster to collect donations for the purpose of self gain.
similarly, we request citizens directly affected by the impact of the quake, for example those whose homes collapsed to now begin repairing those houses so as to help the government.
we say so, because the government alone cannot rebuild all the houses that collapsed.
if the government will be supported, it will be able to quickly repair all the damaged infrastructure such as schools, medical centers, roads and other social services.
we thank organizations, businessmen, civil servants, companies and individuals who continue to contribute to the victims of the incident.
their contributions are crucial in addressing the disaster caused by the earthquake.
we urge all Tanzanians affected by the disasters, to continue providing roofing sheets, blankets, mattresses, maize, rice, bean, oil, money, clothing and various aid to the victims of the quake through the Prime Minister's Office and the Kagera Provincial Office.
Shekifu do you remember Ole Sendeka's?
May 15, 2014
the other day here in parliament several members of parliament got the opportunity to contribute to the budget speech by the Office of the Prime Minister.
everyone who got the opportunity to contribute to the debate said what they wanted to say.
among those who got the chance is Member of Parliament Henry Shekifu, who proclaimed that he was as well also the Chairman of the ruling party in Tanga district.
unsurprisingly, Shekifu has been able to hold elective posts here and there within this country that has no clear selection criteria.
in his contribution, it is as if Shekifu had prepared to attack Korogwe District Commissioner, Mrisho Gambo and he took advantage of the budget of the Office of the Prime Minister to carry out attacks.
what offended Shekfu is the decision by the Korogwe District Commissioner in January this year ordering the detention of Aweso Kipaku (34) the Councilor for Mswaha-Darajani Ward, Mombo Division of Korogwe District, Tanga Province (CCM).
the District Commissioner ordered the Councilor's detention on January 24 this year at 5 pm in the evening and got bail at ten o'clock at night.
it was not only the Councilor but also his fellow colleagues who are, the Chief Executive Officer for Mswaha-Darajani village, Abbas Siafu and the Chairman of the village Council of Dharjan village, Said Kijiwa.
they were detained because of the accusations against them by the Committee on Security and Protection of Korogwe District, that they had participated in inciting the conflict between farmers and herders in Mswaha-Darajani village.
it is not possible to use this opportunity to discuss accurately or vice versa about the District Commissioner's decision, but it is to remind Shekifu a bit about the era when he was the Manyara Provincial Commissioner.
because in his contribution on the budget of the Office of the Prime Minister, Shekifu boasted that he has been a Provincial Commissioner and his did that work professionally without interfering with 'stakeholders', without 'detaining' them.
it is because of that, things cannot be left as they are, Shekifu must reminded of how he had tasted the wine of provincial supremacy, how he was undecided and wavering until he found himself at odds with Simanjiro Member of Parliament, Christopher ole Sendeka.
that's why, the same Shekifu 'wine' of power became too sweet and he began playing politics here and there while he went on with farming activities in the province which he led, land disputes erupted while he sat on the provincial administration seat.
it was as if the provincial administrator at that time tumbled into in a "war" of mutual mutual disrespect with Sendeka and publicly, to the extent that the incident of their hostility 'hit' the news headlines.
if he has forgotten, then without doubt he will remember the incident of him and Sendeka fighting at the internal session for government official of the Sukuro and Kitiangare villages right there in Simanjiro within Manyara Province where he was in charge.
he will clearly recall how he used the "wine" of power to order the expulsion of one Member of Parliament of the Sukuro County Government just because the member is claimed to clapped in support of a point raised by another Member of Parliament that, the ranch project being debated upon was not in the interest of the people of those villages.
without doubt Shekifu can remember that the agenda of that session is the demarcation of the new village of Kitiangare and the setting aside of a sum of 45,000 acres of land from six villages for the implementation of the ranch project that was being implemented by the Ilramatak-Lorkoroney organization.

November 28, 2016
women in Japan quit love?
when Ayumi Saito separated with his boyfriend she was aged 22.
but the Tokyo resident found an alternative and easy means to fill the emptiness left by her lover.
she downloaded a game related to love on her phone and to became part of millions of women in that country who have decided to change their actual love lives into dreams.
"I was lonely," says Saito, who is now 31 years old.
"Japanese men are shy and are not good in giving women complements.
but girls want to hear the words 'I love you'.
male friends she found on games such as "Metro PD: Close To You" - which shows a female investigator finding love that completely changes her life while she struggles with robbery - they did everything her former boyfriend never did.
"when I am tired at the end of the day before I sleep, I was relieved hearing his tender and sweet voice," she told American press agency CNN.
Saito is not a different person.
in the year 2014, the sector of love games in Japan was worth 130 million American dollars.
in a community in which 44.2 percent of women - almost half of those without partners having an age between 18 and 34 years are still virgins, this sector appears to have gone into deep desire of these people in Japan.
the birth of love games
the love games started emerging in Japan in 1980.
identified by the name "bishoujo" mostly they have had a male main character chasing after a beautiful female character.
in the year 1994, a team of female experts in computer languages from gaming company, Koei broke the tradition that was used to and started the first female love game, "Angelique".
the game which involves a young girl who is expected to be "the princess of the world" choosing her right lover, was so successful.
business lady Nanako Higashi and her husband, Yuzi Tsutani saw an opportunity in this largely profitable business.
Japan is the second largest market for cell phone games in the world, with a value of 6.5 billion American dollars, according to Global Games Market Report magazine.
between the year 2000 the two started a gaming business, Voltage, for the sake of women.
"almost all women have depression," says Higashi.
"we wanted to give them something."
that came to be a perfect business strategy.
today Voltage leads in the world in love games for women.
recognize the loses of getting an employment through corruption
unemployment is a challenge of the whole world.
what is different between one country to the other is the size of the problem.
every human is pressed by the basic needs, fulfilling them without money is also impossible, getting money without difficult.
the main source of ma in many people is to be employed or in the government or private institution.
that situation is what causes many people to be ready to do anything in order to be employed.
when asked about bribe money, there are those forced to use their body as gifts to the one offering employment.
those without money promise several months of salary depending on the agreement.
you can find a person who is starting to work and instead of their situation being good because he has sure income, life continues to be hard.
instead he is working for a person.
there are some who are turned into slaves of love.
whenever the job provider needs to fulfill his bodily desires he just requests.
in one office you can even find five people that contributes love to the job provider because they were given jobs through the same fashion.
bribing in order to get a job is a result of ignorance.
you should understand that when you get employed it means that you qualified for the criteria of the job meaning you seem capable to perform the job you were asked and produce results, now what's the bribe for?
there are losses that you will face if you will enter the job through bribing.
if you understand them they will guide you to refuse bribes.
job slavery happens when you get employed through bribes and not when you are qualified according to your qualifications in the curriculum vitae and experience together with how you answered the questions of the interviewers.
the person you bribe places you in the same category with those whom he gave jobs, for that he will command the way he wants job-wise because of the presumption that without him you would have not been employed.
you may think that the bribe you gave him is the qualification for him respecting and giving you value.
there you are lying to yourself, since when you were offering bribes is there any place you registered and signed?
it's because there is no written agreement that is why he is arrogant and you cannot catch him on anything.
furthermore, you will live telling people that a certain boss you gave money to employ you but the way he is oppressing you at work you will think that you entered the job without paying anything.
about bribe of using your body, refuse it completely.
usually, whenever he uses you there is no binding written agreement.
after two days if he turns against you there will be no witnesses.
important guiding questions are these, employment and your body, which over which?
you ask for a tendering coordinator job one person on the panel of employers decides to use your body, is it your body that he will see your capability in the job you asked for?
whoever wants to use your body to give you a job does not respect and value your personality.
you are supposed to ask yourself how many has he used in the same way?
its result is that you get the job then find 10 of whom were used by the greedy boss.
a hundred for his profit.
job security can provide the money and even body then you get employed.
whoever you bribed with money or body is who can give recommendations that you be stopped from work and you cannot get any help even if you decide to say what you have.
first, bribe is a secret oath.
you cannot announce that you gave out the bribe just like the receiver cannot admit that he received.
bribery is a sin and a big mistake, for that it remains a secret of the giver and the receiver.
you can offer the bribe and received then you are denied the employment.
you cannot sue anywhere that you gave bribe because you will be taking yourself into troubles.
when you get employment after giving bribe, all days you will be under pressure whenever you hear the information of employees' inspection.
because you will be afraid for your goodness if it satisfies the levels of the office.
surety of the employment is that which you are employed after you are seen that you will be of help in the institution involved.
and you believe in yourself because you were given good recommendations after answering well the interview questions.
when you are carried to enter into the job you cannot believe in yourself.
that way you will be worried whenever matters of employees' reviews are done.
when told to just present your original certificates of school you will start worrying even if you have them all.
reliance on the giver of employment when enters into the employment to produce good employees that will make him get success.
he who accepts to be bribed it means that he wants anyone as long as he is given whatever he wants.
for that reason if you see a person asking for bribe know that he is not the owner.
he is just misusing the opportunity he has been given.
for that reason know that if he was put then he can be removed and replaced by another.
the world has no secret in any institution that the employment procedures are not implemented by one person.
if he who is at the highest position gave the instructions of you being received at work opposite to the procedures because of the bribe you gave him, that cannot be a secret anymore.
words will be communicated and will spread.
you were told that there is no secret of two people.
the spread of those words is destructive to your employment together with the recruiter that you bribed.
people will talk and you will say that it's a team, but even so they will be surprising the top leadership that if it decides to take action you will not remain safe.

educate the community mandates of the Millennium Development Goals university students appointed
written by Joachim Nyambo, Mbeya.
published 02 December 2016
university students have been appointed as good ambassadors by providing community education on the sustainable millennium goals, to enable them to recognize and participate in their work.
the statement was issued by UN Secretary-General and Director of the United Nations Development Agency (UNDP) Tanzania, Alvaro Rodriguez, at the 17th Millennium Development Goals workshop for students of the Theofilo Kisanji University (TEKU) of Mbeya.
Rodriguez said university students have a great opportunity to spread the education of the Millennium Objectives if they decide to enable the community to understand them and thus it will be easier for stakeholders to achieve the goals and ultimately the thirst for the world to achieve that goal is achieved.
one of the most stressed on goals to reach the community include climate change, which he said the community should be integrated into environmental management to avoid the adverse day-to-day effects due to the damage being done.
he said it is important that the community recognizes the importance of maintaining the environment since doing so will help to slow down climate change which will have a profound effect on current and future generations.
climate change has not impact on the current and future generation.
the community must recognize the importance of maintaining the environment and recognizing this need it is necessary for intelligent people to make known the plans for the present world.
students can do this because you are from the community, said Rodriguez.
we should use Ramadan to remove our political differences.
the faithful people of the Islam religion for now are continuing with the fasting of the holy month of Ramadan which takes them approximately 30 days depending with and accompanying the moon.
this is a period during which those faithful people bring themselves closer to the Almighty God by doing what has instructed in the holy Quran.
this is a month which many uses to help those in need, self-denial, forgiveness and other many things that please the Almighty God.
this journey, this holy month of Ramadan has come at a time when political differences have emerged in the country, differences which are increasing instead of reducing.
in Zanzibar Islands, those political differences now which were caused by the nullification of election results and repeated, have entered into the usual life of citizens who are now discriminating each other from societal, work, business and even faith based engagements.
citizens are discriminating against each other in transport vessels, they are invading each other's farms, they are discriminating each other in mosques and other engagements, and there seems to be no solution for that situation.
the situation hasn't gotten to that level in mainland Tanzania, but acts by politicians show that it could head there.
yesterday, the parliamentarians from the opposition side decided to stop talking with their colleagues in CCM after their plan of wanting the bill opposing the deputy speaker Doctor Tulia Ackson on allegations of discriminating them lacked a solution to date.
this is a bad signal because such things start slowly until they spread to citizens as it is in Zanzibar currently.
we don't like seeing this situation happening without getting a solution because it doesn't give a good indication.
there are no holy writings that promote these discriminatory acts and not finding a solution when differences arise.
all writings insist on love, living in harmony and caring about others.
because the holy month of Ramadan has found this situation ongoing, it is wise to use this holy period to meditate on our country's ways and finding approaches that will be able to safeguard the country from any problems that will arise from lack of love among Tanzanians and lack of resolution efforts.
the point at which every side feels perfect, is the ultimate sign that we all have weakness and it is only the Almighty God who is perfect.
for Christians, the scriptures offer good fortune to the peace makers.
these ones have not yet come out during this period of political differences.
in escorting their Islam brothers, they also have a role in ensuring that this month is used well to safeguard our country against any situation that might caused by these political differences that seem to be growing.
we need to differ politically because it is healthy for the nation when there are different ideas that aim to strengthen one thing.
but when those differences grow and enter into the normal life of the citizen, it is not healthy for the nation because even if the opinions of one side might help the nation, they can't be accommodated by another side, that is not a good thing.
it is our expectation that the citizens will meditate deeply on the state of our nation during this fasting period of the holy month of Ramadan and humble themselves before the Almighty God for Him to give us wisdom to find a way of resolving or preventing this situation from continuing.
those who are not fasting during this period are also required to meditate deeply on our country's direction and find ways of returning things back to the correct line.
leaders smart in suit, hooligans in thoughts
August 15, 2013
back then I once wrote an article by starting with a question that I will review it here as follows: so we are bewitched?
how can it be that we haven't been bewitched but if we have bewitched ourselves?
or is it possible that we have been bewitched and the one who charmed us was bewitched and died?
(they claim that if the person who cast a spell on you dies then you cannot heal).
they are 'silly' questions but they are raise basic emotions considering the trend of our nation currently.
I don't know what God should give us.
he has blessed us with a peaceful and loving country for couple of years.
he gave us Father of the Nation, teacher Nyerere who despite urging for unity among ourselves as Tanzanians, he also fought for unity of the African continent.
Nyerere knew much earlier that it is easy for a country with over 120 tribes to be in pieces if not held together with an ideology that makes us united.
he encouraged politics of socialism that primarily focused on eliminating classes and theoretical and realistic differences, for all of us to remain as Tanzanians.
God has also granted us a country with a lot of resources, riches that even the wealthiest nations of the world wish it could be in their countries.
in a totally disrupting environment, efforts made by Nyerere to unite us began being violated immediately after he relinquished power.
the party that he founded of CCM, turned against him through Zanzibar's resolution, 'hooliganism' that proclaimed the death of socialism tradition.
since that time, the country seems as though 'bewitched'.
we are not in colonialism (since every CMM's manifesto says Tanzania is a country that abides by the principles of the politics of socialism and being independent) and our constitution confirms that.
we are not on socialism, because every foundation that has excelled, that tradition has been disregarded.
with our numerous resources, we have continued to be the poorest country in the world.
instead of being a market of products emanating from our wealth, we have become notorious beggars while our leaders without a shame, dare to openly say that if we do not foreign trips, we will not get development.
okay, continuous trips abroad have succeeded in bringing leaders of the greatest nations of the world, President Xi Jinping of China and later on 'president of the world' Barack Obama of America.
as usual, our leaders walked majestically and bragged that "our country has now made progress that is why important leaders of the world are visiting us."
it's true, the tours by Presidents Jinping and Obama were successful in placing Tanzania on the global map (to market us well across the world).
I remember during the visit by President Obama, a report by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) noted that Tanzania is one of the countries with the fastest growing economy in the world.
who could dispute yet the Chinese and Americans are outwitting each other to tour our country?
but as if a spell has been cast on us, just a few days after Obama's visit, news emerged that there was corruption involving billions of shillings in the preparation of Smart Partnership conference that brought together several African presidents.
does it make sense that just the preparation of Smart Partnership meeting stirs corruption of billions of shillings before the actual plan begins to be implemented?
I once wrote that while Obama is wrestling with his good thoughts of donating American dollars to us, corrupt individuals on their side are anxiously preparing their pockets to grab the funds.
the extortion of funds for preparation of that conference is like just the 'beginning', the actual show is still waiting for funds to start trickling.
as if that's not enough, a few days after Obama's visit, the name of our country started trending again at the international platform, this time on the business of drug tracking.
for sure, you cannot be surprised with someone who believes that we maybe have been bewitched because despite being very lucky for our name to be heard for good reasons across almost all the corners of the world following Obama's visit, we have deliberately spoiled that merit.
it's just like Obama's crippled decision to ignore the gross violation of human rights in Tanzania, was a permission for the state organs and criminals (at times it is difficult to differentiate between a state organ and criminals) to continue risking the safety of the Tanzanians.
we have continued to witness various incidences that continue to soil our country, locally and internationally.
from an incomprehensible standpoint, the police force that isn't ashamed to be seen working for the ruling party CCM to oppress the opposition, emerged with a dangerous strategy of 'disrupting' terrorism cases against opposition politicians.
it is only a bewitched nation that can joke with terrorism.
that is why recently, Judge Simon Lukelelwa gave a strict warning about 'joking with terrorism' when giving judgement in a case dealing with several leaders of Chadema in Tabora.
farming now in the internet
and Bernardine Mutanu.
East Africa countries have introduce the program of installing information in the internet concerning farming and food like a way of preventing food shortage in this area.
while speaking during the launch of that program yesterday, the secretary general of United Nations of East Africa zone (EAC) about business, Mister John Konchella said the statistics of produce and livestock that will be stored in this program will be very important not only to the concerned government but to all the citizen as a whole.
"South African nations are mostly affected by lack of food.
there are some of the areas that are severely affected by hunger even though this is able to give more produce that can provide for all the citizens and also to be sold in foreign countries," he said.
he said among the factors that caused the situation was weaknesses in food exchange among the nations of Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and other EAC countries or areas with surplus food and those with scarce food.
some of the other factors that contributes to this state include cost of production as well as bad weather due to climatic change, explained Mister Konchella.
"based on this fact, EAC has revealed a plan of ensuring food security and to cop with hunger," said Mister Konchella.
he explained that the plan was the first step towards implementing a contract set out among the EAC countries.
according to the agreement, these nations should cooperate to strengthen agriculture and crop production as well as to address food shortage.
relevant states are required to launch the projects of food shortage and production in their words and to make sure it will followed and that there is enough food," said Mister Konchella.
the program contains data for all types of products in each country and the quantity of crop yields available annually in all parts of the EAC.
according to one representative of World Food Program (FAO), that steps is important to ensure that the way of food in different areas are understood quickly.

"look people, this charm is breathing, look at it keenly," the fan was heard and left people in a shocked state to see such superstitious acts in areas of entertainment.
as the actions of finding the charms proceeded, Diamond after getting on stage before starting to sing found himself sliding and falling on stage and stood by himself while the youth who are claimed to be Team Kiba made a loud noise to symbolize that they were happy about the incident happening.
together with Diamond's falling to the floor, the situation continued worsening for him after a poor projection of the music, an act that aroused feelings that there was superstition going on to degrade him musically by showing that he had performed poorly in the show.
bottles are thrown
after seeing the situation worsening as water bottles were thrown on the stage with some of them hitting him and evading others while going on with the show, Diamond decided to get clever to calm the noise by pouring notes.
the issue made the fans and Team Kiba to stop the exercise and start scrambling for the two thousand shilling notes that he poured in three phases.
offertory?
as he kept throwing the notes to the fans, Diamond was heard saying that the money was special for it was offertory to them for the great support though he will not be able to give each one of them.
Diamond like Michael Jackson
however some of the fans who were scrambling and picking the notes were heard saying:
"Michael Jackson used to do such (the late American artist) and he was using superstition and Freemasons.
"Michael was claimed to pour money that had power to mute all whose rose to to shout against him," one fan was heard saying.
surprise
in a most surprising way, Diamond removed his t-shirt and vest, wiped his sweat and threw it to his fans knowing very well that he had wiped sweat that was flowing from his body like water.
Kiba was not supposed to talk?
while Diamond's surprising acts proceeded as well as dirty water bottles with urine being thrown at him, it was claimed that when Kiba entered the artists room he did not want to talk to anyone while it was claimed that it was a major sign that he was not required to talk to anyone for he could lose his power to perform at the show.
police in a burden
while the fans were still in fear about this artists, a police force armed with all paraphernalia to arrest criminals started an operation of arresting youth claimed to be Team Kiba who were rowdy and throwing water bottles containing urine and water who received a thorough beating.
Kiba jumps over a wall
initially before the start of the show superstitious acts were evident more after Ali Kiba entered in the field by jumping over a wall and even after he showed himself up in a special room set aside for artists he did not hold hands with his colleagues.
the artists Ali Kiba ignored are AY, Mwana FA, Shaa, Shilole, Vanessa Mdee and Jux, whom he all found in the room.
